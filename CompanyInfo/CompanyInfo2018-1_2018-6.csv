(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    borrowed from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    founders’ units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised. Does not
    include interest earned on the trust proceeds that may be available to us,
    as described elsewhere in this prospectus.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor has committed to purchase from us an aggregate of 225,000 units, or
“founders’ units,” at $10.00 per unit (for a total purchase price of $2,250,000)
in a private placement that will close simultaneously with the closing of this
offering. Our sponsor has also agreed that if the over-allotment option is
exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, it will purchase from us
additional founders’ units (up to a maximum of 18,750 founders’ units) at a
price of $10.00 per founders’ unit in an amount that is necessary to maintain in
the trust account at $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These
additional founders’ units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. The founder’s units are identical to the units sold
in this offering subject to certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in
this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be
placed in the trust account described below.

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the founders’ units will be
placed in a U.S. — based trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the
conditions of paragraph (d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our redemption of 100% of
the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business combination in
the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of an aggregate of $10,000 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and
directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee
and the repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be made
from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the
completion of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind
will be paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Our
audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to
our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any
interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit
on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to
the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate
an initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants or advisors to assist us with our search for a target
business, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsor, officers and directors in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole
or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held
in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination
(including to pay converting stockholders as described herein) will be disbursed
to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not
expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and any available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we
are permitted to withdraw.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced us an aggregate of
$130,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The advances will be payable without interest on
the consummation of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit. The units
would be identical to the founders’ units. If we do not complete a business
combination, the loans will be forgiven.

Our public stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business
combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share) from the sale of the
common stock offered by us, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions of approximately $10.7 million.

We intend to use approximately $4.2 million of cash on hand to pay fees and
expenses we have incurred in connection with this offering, which include legal
and accounting fees, SEC and FINRA registration fees, printing expenses and
other similar fees and expenses.

We intend to use the entire amount of the net proceeds of this offering to
redeem in full the PIK notes. The PIK notes bear interest at 11.25% per annum
and mature on May 20, 2024. They were originally issued on May 29, 2015, at an
issue price of 97% of their principal amount. The proceeds from the issuance of
the PIK notes were used to pay part of the consideration for the Cadillac Jack
acquisition. The PIK notes were amended on May 30, 2017 in connection with the
repayment of the Seller Notes. Because the initial offering price yielded net
proceeds that are not sufficient to redeem the PIK notes in full, we will use
approximately $0.7 million of cash on hand to redeem the remaining amount of the
PIK notes.

Deutsche Bank AG owns the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the PIK
Notes. As a result, Deutsche Bank AG will receive approximately $154.0 million
of the net proceeds of this Offering, in connection with the redemption of the
PIK Notes. As a result, one of the underwriters in this Offering, Deutsche Bank
Securities Inc., an affiliate of Deutsche Bank AG, is deemed to have a “conflict
of interest” with us within the meaning of Rule 5121."

$115.3 million, or $133.2 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility and create a public market for our common stock. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $35.0 million to fund our development of AM0010 for the
  treatment of PDAC, including our Phase 3 clinical trial in PDAC;           

. approximately $35.0 million to fund our two planned Phase 2b clinical trials 
  in NSCLC; and                                                       

. the remaining proceeds to fund our development of AM0010 for the treatment of
  additional indications, as well as our development of other product candidates
  in our pipeline and other general corporate purposes, which may include the 
  hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of 
  operating as a public company.                                    

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our preclinical and clinical
development activities may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and results
from preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trial or any clinical trials
we may commence in the future, our ability to take advantage of expedited
programs or to obtain regulatory approval for AM0010, and any other product
candidates we may identify and pursue, the timing and costs associated with the
manufacture and supply of AM0010 and other product candidates we may identify
and pursue for clinical development or commercialization and any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term interest-bearing investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit
or government securities."
"RESTORBIO, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/restorbio-inc-1041240-85723,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/restorbio-inc-1041240-85723,424B4,1/29/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12499471,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 5,666,667 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $77.6 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $89.4 million.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $85 million to fund the development of RTB101, alone and in 
  combination with everolimus, for RTIs, through the completion of our ongoing 
  Phase 2b clinical trial of RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus, the
  completion of a subsequent pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, assuming a 
  successful outcome in our Phase 2b clinical trial of RTB101 alone or in 
  combination with everolimus, and the filing of an NDA with the FDA, assuming 
  a successful outcome in our Phase 3 clinical program;

• approximately $16 million to fund the development of RTB101, alone and in 
  combination with other rapalogs such as everolimus, for other indications, 
  through the completion of at least one additional proof of concept trial in an
  additional indication and to fund the development of our other TORC1 follow-on
  candidate and other pipeline candidates; and  

• the remainder, if any, for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes, which may include funding for the costs of operating as a public 
  company.                                                         

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve.
For example, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of
businesses or technologies to continue to build our pipeline, our research and
development capabilities and our intellectual property position, although we
currently have no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any
such transaction. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development and commercialization efforts, the status of and results from
clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. Moreover, our
estimates of the costs to fund our trials are based on the current designs of
the trials. If we were to modify the design of any of these trials, for
instance, to increase the number of patients in the trials, our costs to fund
the trials could increase. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash and cash
equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements at least through 2020, including the completion of our ongoing
Phase 2b clinical trial of RTB101 alone or in combination with everolimus, the
completion of a subsequent pivotal Phase 3 clinical program, assuming a
successful outcome in our Phase 2b clinical trial of RTB101 alone or in
combination with everolimus, and the filing of an NDA with the FDA, assuming a
successful outcome in our Phase 3 clinical program. We have based this estimate
on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available
capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We do not have any committed
external source of funds.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $24.5 million (or
$28.4 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares) after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of September 30, 2017, we had cash of approximately $7.4 million. We intend
to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash, as
follows:

• Approximately $12 million to complete Phase III clinical trials for
  MicroProst;
 
• Approximately $2 million to complete Phase III clinical trials for MicroStat;
 
• Approximately $1.5 million to complete MicroTears registration activities;
 
• Approximately $6.5 million to complete scale-up engineering and manufacturing
  for pivotal trials and FDA approval; and
 
• The remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
We believe that our current cash, along with the net proceeds from this
offering, will be sufficient for us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements for the next 24 months.

The expected net proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient for us to fund
commercialization of any of our product candidates (including marketing and
sales) and we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete the
commercialization of our product candidates, as well as to establish an in-house
manufacturing facility.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our preclinical and clinical trials and other
development and commercialization efforts for our product candidates, as well as
the amount of cash used in our operations. Although we have no present intention
or commitment to do so, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for the
acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, intellectual property or
businesses that complement our business.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other
purposes, and our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of
the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we plan to
invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term,
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.                                                                 

(2) As of September 30, 2017, the sponsor advanced us an aggregate of $15,521 to 
    be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. The $15,521 will be  
    repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $1,150,000 of offering    
    proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other 
    than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust       
    account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this 
    table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital        
    expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth 
    in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust      
    account.  

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $4,375,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions (or $5,031,250 if the underwriter’s over-allotment 
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us 
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the 
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest 
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our  
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for 
    financing. 

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $126,250,000 (or $145,187,500 if the underwriter’s
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $4,375,000 (or $5,031,250
if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
maintained with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee,
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $1,000,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.8% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on assumed interest
rates, we expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income
taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of September 30, 2017, the sponsor advanced us an aggregate of $15,521 to be
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. The advances are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on demand. The advances will be repaid
upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,150,000 of offering proceeds
that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance offering expenses, working capital and/or
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and
directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we
complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts
out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans
would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event
that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned
amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a
price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be
identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise price,
exercisability and exercise period. The terms of such loans by our officers and
directors, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all
rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 18 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
18 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."
GATES INDUSTRIAL CORP PLC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/gates-industrial-corp-plc-1040915-85693,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/gates-industrial-corp-plc-1040915-85693,424B4,1/25/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12495732,"We estimate that the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering, after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions, will be
approximately $694.9 million (or $799.2 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their over-allotment option to purchase additional ordinary shares).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to redeem all €235.0
million ($276.5 million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) principal amount of
euro notes, (ii) to redeem approximately $389.2 million principal amount of
dollar notes, (iii) to redeem our £50,000 redeemable preferred share issued in
connection with the pre-IPO reorganization transactions and (iv) the remainder,
if any, for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of other
outstanding indebtedness. As of September 30, 2017, €235.0 million ($276.5
million equivalent as of September 30, 2017) aggregate principal amount of the
euro notes and $1,190.0 million aggregate principal amount of the dollar notes
were outstanding. The euro notes and dollar notes mature on July 15, 2022 and
have interest rates of 5.75% per annum and 6.00% per annum, respectively. We
also intend to use approximately $150.0 million of cash on hand to redeem an
additional amount of dollar notes, conditioned upon the consummation of this
offering.

We expect any increase in the net proceeds received as a result of the exercise
by the underwriters of their over-allotment option to purchase additional
ordinary shares to correspondingly increase the principal amount of dollar notes
to be redeemed.

Pending specific application of these proceeds, we expect to invest them
primarily in short-term demand deposits at various financial institutions."
MENLO THERAPEUTICS INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/menlo-therapeutics-inc-896578-85699,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/menlo-therapeutics-inc-896578-85699,424B4,1/26/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12497473,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of 7,000,000 shares of common
stock in this offering will be approximately $109.2 million at the initial
public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that net proceeds will be approximately $125.8 million at the initial
public offering price of $17.00 per share after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, as follows:

. approximately $16.0 million of external clinical costs to complete our ongoing
  Phase 2 clinical trials of serlopitant for pruritus associated with atopic 
  dermatitis and psoriasis, and for refractory chronic cough;   

. approximately $23.0 million of external clinical costs to significantly 
  advance our planned Phase 3 development of serlopitant for pruritus associated
  with prurigo nodularis;                                        

. approximately $13.0 million of external development and manufacturing costs 
  primarily associated with supplying serlopitant for our clinical trials, and 
  development and validation of our commercial manufacturing process for 
  serlopitant in preparation for our NDA and MAA submissions;   

. $3.0 million milestone payment to Merck associated with initiating a Phase 3 
  clinical trial; and                                                     

. the remainder for personnel expenses, other development activities, including 
  potentially commencing Phase 3 clinical trials for pruritus associated with 
  atopic dermatitis and psoriasis and for refractory chronic cough, working 
  capital and other general corporate purposes, including the costs of operating
  as a public company.                                   

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and
regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the
exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. As such, our management will retain broad discretion over the
use of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including (i) the time and cost
necessary to advance serlopitant through our ongoing and planned non-clinical
studies and clinical trials; (ii) our ability to obtain regulatory approval or
clearance for and subsequently commercialize our product candidates; and (iii)
the time and cost necessary to develop non-clinical and clinical supplies and a
commercial‑scale manufacturing process for product candidates, as well as the
infrastructure to commercialize our product candidates.

We believe that our existing cash, together with the net proceeds from this
offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations into the fourth
quarter of 2019, enabling us to complete our three ongoing Phase 2 clinical
trials and to significantly advance our planned Phase 3 clinical trials and our
NDA and MAA preparations. Following this offering, we will require substantial
capital to complete clinical development, seek regulatory approval of, and, if
approved, commercialize, serlopitant. We may seek additional funds through
public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, including strategic
collaborations. 

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest‑bearing, investment‑grade securities, certificates of
deposit, or government securities."

this offering and the net proceeds therefrom (together with the net proceeds
from the initial closing of this offering) are in excess of $150 million, then
we will use 50% of the excess of the net proceeds over $150 million to make a
mandatory prepayment of the term loan borrowings under our new credit facility.

The following table illustrates our anticipated use of the net proceeds from
this offering:

(1) Pursuant to the Existing Nine Credit Facility, Nine has a $35.2 million term
    loan. At September 30, 2017, the weighted average interest rate of the term 
    loan was approximately 5.7%. Also, as of September 30, 2017, Nine had $75.0
    million of outstanding revolving borrowings (including letters of credit)
    under the Existing Nine U.S. Revolving Credit Facility and Nine Energy
    Canada Inc. had $9.6 million of outstanding revolving borrowings (including
    letters of credit) under the Existing Nine Canadian Revolving Credit
    Facility. Borrowings under the Existing Nine Credit Facility bear interest
    at a variable rate. At September 30, 2017, the weighted average interest
    rates on borrowings under the Existing Nine U.S. Revolving Credit Facility
    and the Existing Nine Canadian Revolving Credit Facility, all of which were
    incurred to fund working capital, were each approximately 5.7%. All loans
    and other obligations under the Existing Nine Credit Facility are scheduled
    to mature on May 31, 2018. We intend to terminate the Existing Nine Credit
    Facility in connection with this offering.                       

(2) Pursuant to the Existing Beckman Credit Facility, Beckman has a $6.0 million
    term loan tranche (with a weighted average interest rate of 7.0% at         
    September 30, 2017) and a $105.5 million term loan tranche (with a weighted 
    average interest rate of 5.7% at September 30, 2017). Also, as of September 
    30, 2017, Beckman had $9.5 million of outstanding revolving borrowings,     
    which were incurred to fund working capital, under the Existing Beckman     
    Revolving Facility. Borrowings under the Existing Beckman Credit Facility
    bear interest at a variable rate. At September 30, 2017, the weighted
    average interest rate on borrowings under the Existing Beckman Revolving
    Facility was approximately 5.9%. All loans and other obligations under the
    Existing Beckman Credit Facility are scheduled to mature on June 30, 2018,
    except for a portion of the term loans, of which $0.8 million was due in the
    fourth quarter of 2017 and $0.8 million is due in the first quarter of 2018.
    We intend to terminate the Existing Beckman Credit Facility in connection
    with this offering.                                                         

Because an affiliate of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC is a lender under the
Existing Nine Credit Facility and the Existing Beckman Credit Facility and an
affiliate of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC is a lender under the Existing Nine
Credit Facility and may receive 5% or more of the net proceeds of this offering,
Wells Fargo Securities, LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC may be deemed to have
a “conflict of interest” under FINRA Rule 5121, and as a result, this offering
will be conducted under that rule. Pursuant to FINRA Rule 5121, a “qualified
independent underwriter” meeting certain standards is required to participate in
the preparation of the registration statement and prospectus and exercise the
usual standards of due diligence with respect thereto. Goldman Sachs & Co. LLC
has agreed to act as a “qualified independent underwriter” within the meaning of
FINRA Rule 5121 in connection with this offering.

Additionally, affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our
new credit facility and may receive a portion of the net proceeds of this
offering in the form of a mandatory prepayment of the term loan borrowings under
our new credit facility as described above. The term loans mature in July 2020
and may be base rate loans or LIBOR loans. The applicable margin for base rate
loans will vary from 1.50% to 2.75%, and the applicable margin for LIBOR loans
will vary from 2.50% to 3.75%, in each case depending on Nine’s leverage ratio.

We expect to borrow term loans under our new credit facility concurrently with
the consummation of this offering, which we will use, along with a portion of
the net proceeds them this offering, to fully repay the outstanding borrowings
under the Existing Nine Credit Facility and the Existing Beckman Credit
Facility. Availability under our new credit facility is conditioned upon the
consummation of this offering as well as certain other closing conditions,
including a closing liquidity requirement of $60.0 million (after giving effect
to any borrowings to be made on the day on which we utilize our new credit
facility, the issuance of any letters of credit on such date and the payment of
all fees and expenses due under the new credit facility). Such closing liquidity
consists of the sum of our unrestricted cash and cash equivalents and the
availability under our new credit facility."

the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and assuming no exercise
of the underwriters’ over-allotment option) from the sale of the common stock
offered by us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions. We
estimate that the net proceeds to us, if the underwriters exercise their right
to purchase the maximum of additional shares of common stock from us, will be
approximately $1,627 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions in connection with this offering (based upon the initial public
offering price of $14.00 per share).

We currently expect to use (i) an amount equal to approximately $649 million of
the proceeds from this offering to redeem $594 million aggregate principal
amount of Prime Notes and pay the related call premium and (ii) approximately
$15 million of the proceeds from this offering to pay fees and expenses in
connection with this offering, which include legal and accounting fees, SEC and
FINRA registration fees, printing expenses, and other similar fees and expenses.
Following this offering, there will be $2,546 million aggregate principal amount
of Prime Notes outstanding. In addition, we intend to deposit approximately $750
million of the net proceeds from this offering into a separate account, which
amount will be used to redeem the Koch Preferred Securities on a date to be
determined following the consummation of this offering.

The Prime Notes, issued on May 2, 2016, mature on May 15, 2023 and bear interest
at a rate of 9.250% per annum, payable semi-annually in arrears on May 15 and
November 15 of each year, and commenced on November 15, 2016.

Any remaining net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. While we
currently have no specific plan for the use of the remaining net proceeds of
this offering, we anticipate using a significant portion of these proceeds to
implement our growth strategies, generate funds for working capital, and
opportunistically repay outstanding indebtedness. Our management team will
retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering. The
precise amounts and timing of our use of any remaining net proceeds will depend
upon market conditions, among other factors."

approximately $428.2 million (or approximately $493.0 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional common shares
from us), based on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by
the selling shareholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with $517.0
million of net proceeds from our New Senior Secured Term Loan A Facility that
will be effective upon the completion of this offering, to repay the entire
$809.0 million aggregate principal amount of indebtedness outstanding under our
Existing Senior Secured Term Loan B Facility and for general business purposes,
which may include the repayment of $13.1 million outstanding under our
Clearfield, Utah construction loan. Our Existing Senior Secured Term Loan B
Facility matures on December 1, 2022. As of September 30, 2017, under our
Existing Senior Secured Term Loan B Facility, borrowings bore interest at a
floating rate of one-month LIBOR plus 3.75%. Our Clearfield, Utah construction
loan has an initial maturity date of February 21, 2019 and a final maturity
date, including extensions, of February 21, 2021. As of September 30, 2017, our
Clearfield, Utah construction loan bore interest at a floating rate of one-month
LIBOR plus 3.25%. Pending application of such net proceeds, we will invest such
net proceeds in interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing
securities, which are consistent with our intention to continue to qualify for
taxation as a REIT.

On December 26, 2017, we closed into escrow on our New Senior Secured Credit
Facilities, consisting of a five-year, $525.0 million New Senior Secured Term
Loan A Facility, with net proceeds of $517.0 million, and a three-year,
$400.0 million New Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. We expect that,
upon the completion of this offering, $525.0 million will be outstanding under
our New Senior Secured Term Loan A Facility and no borrowings will be
outstanding under our New Senior Secured Revolving Credit Facility. We expect
that borrowings under our New Senior Secured Credit Facilities will bear
interest at the completion of this offering at a floating rate of one-month
LIBOR plus 2.50%.

Affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and Rabo Securities USA, Inc., two of
the underwriters in this offering, are lenders under our Existing Senior Secured
Term Loan B Facility. Accordingly, these lenders will receive their
proportionate share of the net proceeds from this offering used to repay
indebtedness outstanding under our Existing Senior Secured Term Loan B Facility."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that have been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the 
    completion of our initial business combination, $10,500,000, which 
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $12,075,000 if the 
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining 
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our 
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or 
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.


Of the $308.0 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $353.9 million
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $300.0 million
($10.00 per unit), or $345.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and $8.0
million, or up to $8.9 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing
of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The proceeds
held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Prior to such time, such
proceeds will not be invested and will be held in a non-interest bearing trust
account. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account following the
investment of such funds will be approximately $600,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.2% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding
this amount. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
our income taxes, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our
initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of
our public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current
interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will be
sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our founder or an affiliate of our founder, but such
persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor for office space,
secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management
team, in an amount not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of the
date of this prospectus, we have borrowed $91,993 under the promissory note with
our sponsor. These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the
earlier of March 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loans will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering
proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our founder or an affiliate of our
founder may, but is not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we
complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts
out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans
would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event
that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned
amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the
post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our founder or an affiliate of our founder as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to
which the anchor investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 15,000,000 Class A
ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares plus 5,000,000 redeemable warrants
for a purchase price of $10.00 multiplied by the number of Class A ordinary
shares and Class C ordinary shares purchased, or $150,000,000 in the aggregate,
in a private placement to close concurrently with our initial business
combination. The forward purchase agreements provide that prior to signing a
definitive agreement with respect to a potential initial business combination,
and prior to making any material amendment to such definitive agreement
following signing, anchor investors representing over 50% of the forward
purchase shares must approve such potential initial business combination or
amendment, as applicable. In connection with these agreements, we also issued to
the anchor investors an aggregate of 3,750,000 founder shares for $0.01 per
share prior to this offering. The founder shares issued to the anchor investors
are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions as the founder
shares issued to our sponsor. The anchor investors will have redemption rights
with respect to any public shares they own. The forward purchase warrants will
have the same terms as our public warrants, except that, pursuant to the
applicable forward purchase agreement, one of the anchor investors will receive
forward purchase warrants exercisable only for Class C ordinary shares.

The forward purchase agreements and the strategic partnership agreement also
provide that the anchor investors and the BSOF Entities are entitled to (i) a
right of first refusal with respect to any proposed issuance of additional
equity or equity-linked securities (including working capital loans from our
founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) by us, including
for capital raising purposes, or if we offer or seek commitments for any equity
or equity-linked security to backstop any such capital raise, in connection with
the closing of our initial business combination (other than the units we are
offering by this prospectus and their component public shares and warrants, the
founder shares (and Class A ordinary shares and/or Class C ordinary shares for
which such founder shares are convertible), the forward purchase shares, forward
purchase warrants and the private placement warrants, and any securities issued
by us as consideration to any seller in our initial business combination and
warrants issued upon the conversion of working capital loans to us made by our
founder that are convertible into private placement warrants) and
(ii) registration rights with respect to (A) the forward purchase securities and
Class A ordinary shares and Class C ordinary shares underlying the anchor
investors’ forward purchase warrants and the anchor investors’ and BSOF
Entities’ founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants
acquired by the anchor investors, including any time after we complete our
initial business combination.

In addition, the forward purchase agreements for two of our anchor investors
provide each such anchor investor with (i) the right to designate (prior to the
consummation of a Business Combination) and the right to request the designation
of (following the consummation of a Business Combination) one observer to our
board of directors and (ii) the right to acquire, at the same price paid by,
directly or indirectly, and on the same terms and conditions as, our founder, a
number of founder shares equal to its pro rata share, based on its allocation of
forward purchase shares, of five percent of the founder shares of any special
purpose acquisition company sponsored by our founder for 10 years following the
closing of our initial business combination, which we refer to as the new
acquisition company. Further, such forward purchase agreements for the same two
anchor investors provide such investors with the right to purchase up to an
aggregate of $63,000,000 in equity securities of the new acquisition company
substantially similar to the forward purchase securities on the same or more
favorable terms as new investors in such equity securities.

The strategic partnership agreement provides that, so long as the Company
remains a “blank check company” as such term is defined in Rule 419 under the
Securities Act and prior to our initial business combination, the BSOF Entities
have the right to designate one observer to our board of directors.

The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares may be used as part of
the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, expenses
in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in
the post-transaction company. These purchases will be required to be made
regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public
shareholders and are intended to provide us with minimum funding level for our
initial business combination. Our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed,
pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of,
or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have
entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination
or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months
after the closing of this offering."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this prospectus. These
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $750,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $10,500,000, which
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $12,075,000 if
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government 
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
    will be approximately $2,400,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.8%
    per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
Nasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust account.
Of the $307,500,000 in gross proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $353,400,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $300 million
($10.00 per unit), or $345 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, after deducting
$6,000,000 in underwriting discounts and commissions payable upon the closing of
this offering (or $6,900,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) and an aggregate of $1.5 million to pay expenses in
connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following
this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$2,400,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.8% per year; however, we can
provide no assurances regarding this amount. We expect that the interest earned
on the trust account will be sufficient to pay income taxes. We will not be
permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except for the withdrawal of interest to fund our working capital
requirements (subject to an annual limit of $250,000) and/or to pay our taxes,
if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to
modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we have not consummated our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering. However, our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association provides that, following this offering and prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination, we will be prohibited from issuing
additional securities that would entitle the holders thereof to (i) receive
funds from the trust account or (ii) vote as a class with our public shares
(a) on any initial business combination or (b) to approve an amendment to our
amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to extend the time
we have to consummate a business combination beyond 24 months from the closing
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $15,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are
utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The
warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set
forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no
written agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of
our initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties
other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."
INDUSTRIAL LOGISTICS PROPERTIES TRUST,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/industrial-logistics-properties-trust-1038269-85402,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/industrial-logistics-properties-trust-1038269-85402,424B4,1/16/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12478198,"We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this Offering will be
approximately $435.9 million (or approximately $503.4 million if the
underwriters fully exercise their overallotment option), after deducting the
Transaction Costs.

We intend to set aside approximately $2 million of the net proceeds from this
Offering for working capital and use the balance of such proceeds to reduce the
amount outstanding under our credit facility. Accordingly, we expect to reduce
the amount outstanding under our credit facility by approximately
$433.9 million. If the underwriters fully exercise their overallotment option,
the reduction in the amount outstanding under our credit facility would be
approximately $501.4 million. After applying the net proceeds from this Offering
as described above, we expect that the aggregate principal amount outstanding
under our credit facility will be approximately $316.1 million. Our credit
facility allows for maximum aggregate borrowings of up to $750 million and, upon
the completion of this Offering, will mature on December 29, 2021. Amounts
outstanding under our credit facility bear interest at a variable annual rate
equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus a premium, which will
vary depending on the amount of our leverage. As of January 11, 2018, the annual
interest rate on our credit facility was 2.88%.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters are lenders under our credit facility
and will receive a pro rata portion of the net proceeds from this Offering used
to reduce the amount outstanding under our credit facility.

Although we anticipate that substantially all of the net proceeds from this
Offering will be promptly applied to reduce the amount outstanding under our
credit facility, pending such use of proceeds, we may invest the net proceeds
from this Offering in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
government securities and cash, that are consistent with our intention to
qualify for taxation as a REIT."
LIBERTY OILFIELD SERVICES INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/liberty-oilfield-services-inc-1015621-82821,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/liberty-oilfield-services-inc-1015621-82821,424B4,1/16/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12476485,"We expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $194.5
million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses of approximately $21.9 million, in the aggregate.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering received by us to
Liberty LLC in exchange for Liberty LLC Units. Liberty LLC will use the net
proceeds (i) to repay our outstanding borrowings and accrued interest under our
ABL Credit Facility, totaling approximately $30.1 million as of December 31,
2017, (ii) to repay 35% of our outstanding borrowings, accrued interest and
prepayment premium under the Term Loan Facility, totaling approximately $62.2
million as of December 31, 2017 and (iii) for general corporate purposes,
including additional repayment of debt and funding a portion of our 2018 and
other future capital expenditures. We intend to use any net proceeds received by
us from the exercise of the underwriters’ option to redeem shares of Class A
common stock or Liberty LLC Units from certain Legacy Owners.

Our Term Loan Facility matures on September 19, 2022, and our ABL Credit
Facility matures 90 days prior to the Term Loan Facility. As of December 31,
2017, the total amount outstanding under the Credit Facilities was approximately
$204.6 million and bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 8.34%.
The borrowings consist of $174.6 million under the Term Loan Facility that bears
interest at 9.21% as of December 31, 2017, and $30.0 million outstanding under
the ABL Credit Facility, which bears interest at 3.28%. While we currently do
not have plans to immediately borrow additional amounts under our Credit
Facilities, we may at any time reborrow amounts repaid under the ABL Credit
Facility, and we may do so to fund our capital program and for other general
corporate purposes.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our Class A
common stock by the selling shareholder. We will pay all expenses related to
this offering, other than underwriting discounts and commissions related to any
shares sold by the selling shareholder."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. This
    amount will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set 
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as 
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $8,750,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or $10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment 
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred 
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $250,000,000 (or $287,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $8,750,000 (or
$10,062,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $2,350,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 0.94% per year; however, we can provide no
assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations and up to $500,000 of interest which may be released
to us for working capital purposes, the proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account
until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business
combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other assets, companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is
due at the earlier of March 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan
will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds
not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or
their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to compliance with
applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going- private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon completion of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, and
(iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months following the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any limitations
(including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the
proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."
"CUE BIOPHARMA, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cue-biopharma-inc-968445-84805,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/cue-biopharma-inc-968445-84805,424B1,12/21/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12440977,"Based on an initial public offering price of $7.50 per share, we estimate that
the net proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock in this offering, after
deducting estimated underwriting commissions and estimated offering expenses,
will be approximately $36,875,000 if we sell the minimum of $40,000,000 of
common stock or $66,640,000 if we sell all $70,000,000 of common stock in this
offering. However, this is a best efforts offering and, in the event that the
minimum amount of common stock is not sold and all funds are returned to
purchasers, we will not sell any shares or receive any proceeds.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fund:

• $27 million to $29 million, if we sell the minimum of $40,000,000 of common
  stock, or $48 million to $52 million, if we sell the maximum of $70,000,000
  of common stock, of ongoing research and development of our drug candidates
  and platform technologies including, but not limited to, investigational new
  drug application (“IND”) enabling studies, CMC drug manufacturing, IND filing,
  initiating clinical studies, purchasing necessary equipment and other
  research-related purchases, salaries for current and new personnel; and
 
• $5 million to $7 million, if we sell the minimum of $40,000,000 of common
  stock, or $8 million to $10 million, if we sell the maximum of $70,000,000 of
  common stock, of general corporate purposes, including patent portfolio
  development and maintenance costs, working capital, business development,
  administrative support services, hiring of additional personnel and the costs
  of operating as a public company.
 
We believe that the net proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to allow
us to:

• complete IND-enabling studies for our lead product candidate, file such IND
  and initiate the Phase I trial for that candidate;
 
• identify, optimize and nominate one additional drug candidate for

The amounts that we actually spend for any specific purpose may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors including, but not limited
to, the pace of progress of our research and development efforts, unexpected
difficulties arising in the process of protecting our intellectual property,
market conditions, changes in or revisions to our marketing strategies and the
number of shares of common stock sold in this offering. In addition, we may use
a portion of any net proceeds to acquire complementary products, technologies or
businesses; however, we do not have plans for any acquisitions at this time. We
will have significant discretion in the use of any net proceeds. Investors will
be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the
proceeds of any sale of our common stock.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest our
net proceeds from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States government.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering (assuming that at least the
minimum amount of common stock offered is sold), combined with our existing cash
resources, will be sufficient to fund our projected operating requirements into
and possibly through the second half of 2018. However, the expected net proceeds
from this offering are not expected to be sufficient for us to complete the
development and commercialization of any of our drug candidates or platform
technologies. Until we are able to generate sustainable revenues that generate a
profit, we expect to finance our future cash needs through public or private
equity offerings, debt financings or corporate collaboration and licensing
arrangements. However, there can be no assurances that we will be able to obtain
additional financing on acceptable terms and in the amounts necessary to fully
fund our future operating requirements."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
    from the funds we received from our initial shareholders described below.
    These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to
    us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private warrants.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at
    approximately $1,000,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Certain of our initial shareholders have committed that they or their designees
will purchase the private warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of
$4,750,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. They have also agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they or their
designees will purchase from us an additional number of private warrants (up to
a maximum of 450,000 private warrants, for a total of 5,200,000 private
warrants, or a total purchase price of $5,200,000, if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant necessary to
maintain in the trust account $10.10 per unit sold to the public in this
offering. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are
identical to the warrants sold in this offering subject to certain limited
exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$101,000,000, or $116,150,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account at Oppenheimer & Co., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which
invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not
be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Atlantic-Pacific Capital, Inc. and UCG International Corp.,
affiliates of certain of our officers and directors, of a monthly fee in an
aggregate amount of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being
agreed to by Atlantic-Pacific Capital, Inc. and UCG International Corp. for our
benefit and is not intended to provide our officers or directors with
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services, that the fee charged by Atlantic-Pacific Capital, Inc. and UCG
International Corp. is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, the underwriting
fees, the business combination marketing agreement fee and the repayment of
$200,000 of non-interest bearing loans from Union Group International Holdings
Limited, one of our initial shareholders and an affiliate of Juan Sartori, our
Chairman (none of which payments will be made from the proceeds of this offering
held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial business
combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our initial
shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such entity and individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our initial shareholders,
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested
director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the
amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the
extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an
initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$1,000,000. We intend to use the proceeds for legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations, due diligence of
prospective target businesses, legal and accounting fees related to SEC
reporting obligations, the monthly administrative fee described above, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to Ladenburg Thalmann, CIM
Securities, LLC and Atlantic-Pacific Capital, Inc. equal to 3.5% of the gross
proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees
which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial business
combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from the up to $100,000 of interest (which shall be net
of taxes payable) that may be earned on the funds held in the trust account that
will be available to us for such purposes.

As of the date of this prospectus, Union Group International Holdings Limited,
one of our initial shareholders and an affiliate of Juan Sartori, our Chairman,
has loaned us an aggregate of $200,000 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and
expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the consummation of this
offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available
to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 21 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem
reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial
business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to
$1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per
warrant. The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. In the event
that the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts,
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in connection with our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period, (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares, or sells such
shares to us in a tender offer, in connection with a business combination which
we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect our public
shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a
business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a
business combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering. This
redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, whether
proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or
director nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a 
    loan from our sponsor of $169,420. This loan will be repaid upon completion
    of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses.

(3) In addition, the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. The underwriters will
    not receive any underwriting discounts or commissions on the shares
    purchased in this offering by the Deerfield Funds. Upon completion of our 
    initial business combination, $7,875,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters' deferred commissions (or up to $9,187,500 if the underwriters'
    option to purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to 
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately 
    $2,500,000 to be available to us annually from interest earned on the funds
    held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this 
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.0% per annum based upon current 
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In 
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our 
    sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
    of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial 
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. 
    Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post
    business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of
    the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement 
    warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an
    affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, if any, 
    have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
    such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our
    sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and 
    directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to 
    loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek 
    access to funds in our trust account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

(7) Mr. Wolfe, our Chief Financial Officer, will be entitled to receive $7,500
    per month for his services prior to the consummation of our initial business
    combination, subject to the terms of a strategic services agreement that we
    will enter into with Mr. Wolfe prior to the consummation of this offering.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, 
approximately $250,000,000 (or approximately $287,500,000 if the underwriters'
option to purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $2,500,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 1.0% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal
or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to
pay taxes and fund our working capital requirements, until the earlier of
(i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of
our public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to
stockholders' rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the
redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the
requirements of law). The underwriters will be entitled to $7,875,000 (or up to
$9,187,500 if the underwriters' option to purchase additional units is exercised
in full) of deferred underwriting compensation upon the completion of our
initial business combination.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust 
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion 
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.  

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we 
will pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities 
and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We will also be
obligated to pay Mr. Wolfe, our Chief Financial Officer, $7,500 per month for
his services prior to the consummation of our initial business combination,
subject to the terms of a strategic services agreement that we will enter into
with Mr. Wolfe prior to the consummation of this offering.

Our sponsor has loaned us $169,420 for a portion of the expenses of this 
offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier
of June 30, 2018 or the closing of this offering. This loan will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has
been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to 
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their 
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the sellers or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC's ""penny stock""
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash 
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of our public shares in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders' rights or 
pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months 
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described in this prospectus and any limitations (including but not limited to 
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In 
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of 
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after this 
offering in connection with the completion of our business combination, and each
of the Deerfield Funds has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to
the public shares it purchases in this offering. In addition, our initial 
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete 
our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our 
sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions 
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a 
    loan from our sponsor of $169,420. This loan will be repaid upon completion
    of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses.

(3) In addition, the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. The underwriters will
    not receive any underwriting discounts or commissions on the shares
    purchased in this offering by the Deerfield Funds. Upon completion of our 
    initial business combination, $7,875,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters' deferred commissions (or up to $9,187,500 if the underwriters'
    option to purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to 
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of 
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination. 
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately 
    $2,500,000 to be available to us annually from interest earned on the funds
    held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this 
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.0% per annum based upon current 
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In 
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our 
    sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated
    to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
    of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial 
    business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
    capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no 
    proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. 
    Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post
    business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of
    the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement 
    warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our sponsor, an
    affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, if any, 
    have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
    such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our
    sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and 
    directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to 
    loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek 
    access to funds in our trust account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

(7) Mr. Wolfe, our Chief Financial Officer, will be entitled to receive $7,500
    per month for his services prior to the consummation of our initial business
    combination, subject to the terms of a strategic services agreement that we
    will enter into with Mr. Wolfe prior to the consummation of this offering.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants, 
approximately $250,000,000 (or approximately $287,500,000 if the underwriters'
option to purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $2,500,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 1.0% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal
or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to
pay taxes and fund our working capital requirements, until the earlier of
(i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of
our public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to
stockholders' rights or pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the
redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject to the
requirements of law). The underwriters will be entitled to $7,875,000 (or up to
$9,187,500 if the underwriters' option to purchase additional units is exercised
in full) of deferred underwriting compensation upon the completion of our
initial business combination.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust 
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion 
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.  

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we 
will pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities 
and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees. We will also be
obligated to pay Mr. Wolfe, our Chief Financial Officer, $7,500 per month for
his services prior to the consummation of our initial business combination,
subject to the terms of a strategic services agreement that we will enter into
with Mr. Wolfe prior to the consummation of this offering.

Our sponsor has loaned us $169,420 for a portion of the expenses of this 
offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier
of June 30, 2018 or the closing of this offering. This loan will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has
been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business 
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to 
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their 
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the sellers or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net 
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC's ""penny stock""
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash 
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of our public shares in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders' rights or 
pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months 
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described in this prospectus and any limitations (including but not limited to 
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In 
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of 
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after this 
offering in connection with the completion of our business combination, and each
of the Deerfield Funds has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to
the public shares it purchases in this offering. In addition, our initial 
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete 
our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if our 
sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares
in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions 
from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame."
"FARMMI, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/farmmi-inc-1037542-85343,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/farmmi-inc-1037542-85343,424B4,2/20/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12565222,"We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $5,067,472 ($6,720,000
offering proceeds, less underwriting discount of $537,600, non-accountable
expense allowance of $100,800 and other offering expenses of approximately
$1,014,128).

The net proceeds from this offering must be remitted to China before we will be
able to use the funds to grow our business. We are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi Technology,
through capital contributions or parent/subsidiary loans, subject to approvals
from or registrations with relevant PRC government authorities. We plan to use
the capital contribution to fund Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi Technology. We
expect that a properly submitted application will be approved in the ordinary
course of business; however, we cannot guarantee such an approval will occur or
be timely. If our application for a capital contribution is denied, we will use
the parent/subsidiary loan method of funding Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi
Technology.

As mentioned, we currently anticipate financing our subsidiaries by means of
capital contributions. We currently anticipate using approximately 80% of the
gross proceeds from this offering to increase the registered capital of Farmmi
Enterprise and Farmmi Technology (after which time Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi
Technology may apply such funds to the purposes described herein). The increase
in registered capital will require prior approval from (i) MOFCOM to increase
Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi Technology’s registered capital, (ii) SAIC to alter
Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi Technology’s business certificate to reflect the
increase in registered capital and (iii) SAFE to allow Farmmi Enterprise and
Farmmi Technology’s bank to convert U.S. dollars into RMB in order to fund such
increased registered capital, or each of the foregoing agencies’ respective
local counterparts. This approval process typically takes 30 to 90 days in
total, and sometimes longer, from the time MOFCOM or its local branches receive
all the required application documents to begin the process. The remaining
approximately 20% of such gross proceeds will be used to pay expenses related to
this offering as well as for other general corporate purposes.

We plan to remit money to China using the capital contribution method. The
approval from MOFCOM is the key approval in the capital contribution process,
and we believe all other approvals are ministerial if MOFCOM approves such
increase in registered capital. We have not yet initiated this process but
intend to start the process immediately upon completion of the offering. We do
not foresee any problem receiving necessary government approvals for a capital
contribution; however, if our application is rejected, we would remit money to
China through a parent/subsidiary loan instead. If we were to provide funding to
Farmmi Enterprise and Farmmi Technology through parent/subsidiary loans (rather
than the capital contribution method), the total amount of such loans may not
exceed $60,000,000), which is the difference between Farmmi Enterprise and
Farmmi Technology’s total investment amount as approved by the foreign
investment authorities (currently $60,000,000), and Farmmi Enterprise’s
registered capital (currently $30,000,000), and Farmmi Technology’s registered
capital (currently $30,000,000). Such parent/subsidiary loans must also be
registered with the SAFE, which registration usually takes no more than 20
business days after application to complete. The cost for obtaining such
approvals and completing such registration is minimal.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The
procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this
offering, and we will be unable to use the funds in China until remittance is
completed. We have not yet initiated the process of remitting money to China
using either method but will begin to do so promptly upon completion of this
offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows (as to such uses
in China, after we complete the remittance process described below), and we have
listed the specific uses of proceeds below.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our Ordinary Shares. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you. Net proceeds, if any, from
exercise of the underwriter's over-allotment option will be used to fund working
capital.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus."

to issue up to 6,000,000 ordinary shares in the combined offering. Our estimated
use of proceeds below assumes: (a) the issuance of 2,430,000 ordinary shares (or
1,215,000 ADSs) in this offering and an additional 170,966 ordinary shares (or
85,483 ADSs) if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
based on the estimated initial public offering price per ADS of $9.88, (b) the
issuance of 3,399,034 ordinary shares in the German preemptive rights offering,
and (c) for amounts expressed in U.S. dollars, an exchange rate of €1.00 to
$1.2355 based upon the prevailing exchange rate reported by Bloomberg and used
by the parties as of the date hereof.

Based on the assumptions set forth above, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us from this offering will be approximately $9.31 million, or $10.09 million if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, and the net
proceeds to us from the German preemptive rights offering will be approximately
€13.60 million (or $16.80 million), for a total net proceeds to us from the
combined offering of $26.11 million, or $26.89 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, in each case after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $0.96 million, or
approximately $1.0 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, and estimated offering expenses payable by us, of
approximately $1.73 million (assuming, in each case, completion of the temporary
share loan arrangement in connection with and issuance of new shares related to
this offering”).

We intend to use approximately $15.00 million of the net proceeds from the
combined offering to increase our marketing and sales organization in the U.S.
We also intend to use approximately $6.00 million of the net proceeds of the
combined offering to continue to fund the following clinical trials of Ameluz®
(and to make regulatory filings for marketing approval of Ameluz®, both for
geographic expansion and the extension of the indications for Ameluz®): (i) our
clinical trial comparing the efficacy of Ameluz® PDT with PDT using just the
vehicle that is used to deliver the active ingredient in Ameluz®, in combination
with photodynamic therapy when using our BF-RhodoLED® lamp, in the treatment of
superficial basal cell carcinoma, (ii) our clinical trial investigating the
field-directed treatment of actinic keratosis on the extremities and the trunk
with Ameluz®, (iii) our clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of
Ameluz® versus placebo in the treatment of Bowen’s disease (squamous cell
carcinoma in situ) with photodynamic therapy when using our BF-RhodoLED® lamp
and (iv) our clinical trial evaluating the safety and efficacy of Ameluz® at an
application thickness of 1 mm versus application of a thin layer of Ameluz® in
the treatment of mild to severe actinic keratosis on the face and/or scalp with
photodynamic therapy when using our BF-RhodoLED® lamp. We expect to be able to
complete all of these clinical trials and the related regulatory filings and
marketing approval processes with the proceeds from this offering and our other
available sources of liquidity (including the proceeds from our concurrent
German preemptive rights offering). We will use the remainder of the net
proceeds of the combined offering, if any, for general corporate purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, the timing and success of any clinical trials and preclinical studies
we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions, the status
of our sales and marketing efforts, the amounts of proceeds actually raised in
this offering and the amount of cash generated by our operations. Because we
operate in a very dynamic and highly competitive industry, the actual use of
proceeds may differ substantially from the ranges indicated above. Our
management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest them in short-term and
medium-term interest-bearing instruments."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or
approximately $17.8 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

. approximately $6.0 million for commercialization activities related to our 
  Pure-Vu system; and

. approximately $6.0 million for research and development activities, including
  clinical and regulatory development and the continued development and
  enhancement of our Pure-Vu system.

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, including the costs of
operating as a public company. Although we currently anticipate that we will use
the net proceeds from this offering as described above, there may be
circumstances where a reallocation of funds is necessary. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including our
sales and marketing and commercialization efforts, demand for our products, our
operating costs and the other factors described in this prospectus. Accordingly,
our management will have flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this
offering. An investor will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic,
financial or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the
proceeds. 

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the
acquisition or licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other
assets or businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, we
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of the
    gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and concurrently with the completion
    of our initial business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the
    underwriter’s deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriter’s
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter 
    from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining funds, less amounts
    released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders, will be released to
    us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the
    deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a 
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special 
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we 
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The 
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only 
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less 
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government 
    treasury obligations. Assuming an interest rate of 0.5% per year, we 
    estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $1.0
    million per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this 
    amount.

(5) Assumes no exercise of the underwriter’s over-allotment option.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.

Of the $206.0 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $206.6 million
if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full, $200.0 million
($10.00 per unit), or $230.0 million if the underwriter’s over-allotment option
is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and
$6.0 million, or up to $6.6 million if the underwriter’s over-allotment option
is exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the
closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest income (if any) to pay our
income taxes, if any, until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable
to consummate an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) the redemption of our
public shares properly submitted in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve an amendment to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering. Based on current
interest rates, we expect that interest income earned on the trust account (if
any) will be sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, together with funds available to us
from loans from our sponsor, will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to
which such proceeds are allocated. However, if our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but such
persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2018
or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. Except as set forth above,
the terms of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our
initial business combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other
than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $61.0 million, or
approximately $70.8 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based upon the initial public offering price of $13.00 per
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined with
certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of the
proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or strategic investments in
complementary businesses or technologies. We do not currently have any plans for
any such acquisitions or investments. We have not allocated specific amounts of
net proceeds for any of these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

of shares of common stock in this offering, after deducting the estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with borrowings
under our New Credit Facility, as follows: 

• approximately $79.1 million to fully repay indebtedness under our Revolving 
  Credit Facility; and 

• approximately $11.2 million, together with a prepayment fee of 3%, or 
  approximately $1.3 million, to fully repay the remaining outstanding 
  indebtedness under our Term Loan following the Term Loan Conversion.

We intend to use any net proceeds we receive from the exercise of the 
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to repay borrowings under our
New Credit Facility and for general corporate purposes.

As of September 30, 2017, we had $79.1 million of borrowings outstanding and
$5.4 million outstanding letters of credit under the Revolving Credit Facility
and the ability to incur an additional $20.0 million of borrowings. As of
September 30, 2017, the weighted average interest rate on amounts borrowed under
the Revolving Credit Facility was approximately 5.99%. We have incurred this
indebtedness from time to time under the Revolving Credit Facility to finance
certain acquisitions, to fund capital expenditures and for working capital
purposes. The Revolving Credit Facility matures on September 9, 2018. In
connection with the consummation of this offering, we intend to enter into the
New Credit Facility, which we expect to have approximately $13.0 million of
borrowings outstanding and $60.8 million of availability for future borrowings.

As of September 30, 2017, we had $43.2 million of borrowings outstanding under
our Term Loan, including $3.2 million of capitalized interest. Interest on the
unpaid principal is at a rate of 10.0% per annum, accrues on a daily basis and
is paid in arrears at the end of each fiscal quarter. At the end of each quarter
all accrued and unpaid interest is paid in kind by capitalizing and adding to
the outstanding principal balance. We incurred this indebtedness under the Term
Loan to repay $22 million of existing indebtedness, fund balance sheet growth
and for general corporate purposes. The Term Loan matures on December 19, 2020.
At or immediately prior to the closing of this offering, pursuant to the Term
Loan Conversion, $33.6 million of outstanding indebtedness under our Term Loan
will convert in to shares of common stock of the Company at the initial public
offering price, and the remaining borrowings under our Term Loan will be repaid
as described above.

Affiliates of Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith Incorporated and Citigroup
Global Markets Inc. are lenders under our Revolving Credit Facility, and are
each expected to receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering due
to the repayment of borrowings thereunder. Accordingly, this offering is being
made in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121. Additionally, an affiliate of Barclays
Capital Inc. is a lender under our Revolving Credit Facility and will receive a
portion of the proceeds from this offering."

that we are offering will be approximately $137.5 million after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses. If the underwriters'
option in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds
will be approximately $158.9 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on hand,
to repay a portion of the outstanding loans under our existing senior credit
agreement. We intend to refinance the remaining portion of those outstanding
loans with proceeds from the Proposed Debt Refinancing. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares, we intend to use those net
proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of 
debt. As of September 30, 2017, we had $517.7 million aggregate principal amount
of outstanding term loans under our existing senior credit agreement. We
incurred $125.0 million of this debt in February 2017 to pay a special dividend
to our stockholders. These term loans mature on October 31, 2021 and, as of
September 30, 2017, bore interest at a rate equal to 6.58% per annum. This
offering is not conditioned on the closing of the new senior credit agreement or
the repayment of the existing senior credit agreement. If we do not enter into
the new senior credit agreement, the existing senior credit agreement will
remain in place.

Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan
to invest the net proceeds we receive in this offering in short-term and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments,
certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed U.S. government obligations."

approximately $31.2 million, in the aggregate.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds of this offering to Cactus LLC in
exchange for CW Units.

We intend to cause Cactus LLC to use (i) approximately $251.0 million to repay 
the borrowings outstanding under its term loan facility and (ii) approximately 
$154.8 million to redeem CW Units from the Existing Owners.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' 
option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock to Cactus LLC in 
exchange for additional CW Units, and to cause Cactus LLC to use any such amounts
to redeem additional CW Units from the Existing Owners.

The term loan facility matures on July 31, 2020. As of September 30, 2017, the 
term loan facility had an outstanding balance of approximately $249.2 million 
and bore interest at a weighted average interest rate of 7.3%. Approximately 
$164.9 million, $77.5 million and $21.6 million of the borrowings under the term
loan facility were incurred to make cash distributions to the Existing Owners,

approximately $61.1 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares is exercised in full) from the sale of the shares of common stock offered
by us in this offering, based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per
share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility to support our operations, to create a public market for our common
stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• upon U.S. and EU regulatory approval of DWP-450, an aggregate of $13,787,500
  to pay certain milestone payments to Daewoong and the Evolus contributors
  pursuant to the Daewoong Agreement and amended purchase agreement,
  respectively, as well as one-time bonuses to certain of our employees; 

• approximately $25,000,000 to conduct pre-commercial launch activities,    
  including building our commercialization infrastructure to hire, train, deploy
  and support our specialty sales force and developing physician education,
  brand awareness campaigns and other marketing efforts;         

• $5,000,000 to remunerate ALPHAEON for a portion of the outstanding related
  party borrowings; and                                                     

• the remainder for working capital, research and development and general   
  corporate purposes.                                                       

The costs and timing of biological product development, marketing approval and
product launch are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and can
often change. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the FDA's review of our BLA, the EMA’s review of our
MAA and Health Canada’s review of our NDS, the scale of our initial commercial
launch, whether or not we enter into distribution arrangements for DWP-450 with
third parties outside of the United States, our operating costs and expenditures
and the other factors. Accordingly, our management will have significant
flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering and investors will
be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the aggregate net
proceeds.

Based on our estimated use of proceeds, we anticipate that the net proceeds from
this offering will be sufficient to fund our launch and initial
commercialization of DWP-450, if approved. However, we may require additional
funds earlier than we currently expect if, in the event that we are required to
conduct additional clinical trials, we experience a delay in receiving marketing
approval of DWP-450 or market acceptance of DWP-450 is slower than expected. We
may seek any necessary funds through a combination of private and public equity
offerings, debt financings and collaborations, strategic partnerships and
licensing arrangements. Additional financing may not be available when we need
it or may not be available on terms that are favorable to us. Because of the
risks and uncertainties associated with the development and commercialization of
DWP-450, we may not have or be able to obtain all of the funds required to
commercialize DWP-450.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short
and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

approximately US$99.0 million, or approximately US$103.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately US$29.7 million for research and development of products,
  services and technologies;                                                 

• approximately US$29.7 million for selling and marketing; and

• approximately US$39.6 million for general corporate purposes and working   
  capital and potential strategic investments and acquisitions, although we have
  not identified any specific investments or acquisition opportunities at this 
  time.                                                              

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. 

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our VIEs only
through loans, subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval requirements. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of  $200,000,000 (or $230,000,000
    if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
 
(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    January 12, 2018, we had borrowed approximately $172,331 (of up to $300,000
    available to us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a
    portion of the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon
    completion of this offering out of the $650,000 of offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
    underwriting commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than
    as set forth in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the
    $850,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside 
    for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be
    used for post-closing working capital expenses.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $7,000,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s
    deferred commissions (or $8,050,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination
    target in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $202,000,000 (or $232,300,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $7,000,000 (or $8,050,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $1,616,000 per year, assuming
an interest rate of 0.80% per year; however, we can provide no assurance
regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
(A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24
months from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to any other
provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business combination
activity, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account, as well as the $25,000,000 private placement described elsewhere
in this prospectus, for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of  $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
January 12, 2018, we had borrowed approximately $172,331 under the promissory
note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
March 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the
closing of this offering out of the $850,000 of offering proceeds not held in
the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of  $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

Our sponsor has committed, pursuant to a forward purchase contract with us, to
purchase, in a private placement for gross proceeds of  $25,000,000 to occur
concurrently with the consummation of our initial business combination,
2,500,000 of our units on substantially the same terms as the sale of units in
this offering at $10.00 per unit, and 625,000 shares of Class A common stock.
The funds from the sale of units will be used as part of the consideration to
the sellers in the initial business combination; any excess funds from this
private placement will be used for working capital in the post-transaction
company. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders
electing to redeem their public shares and provides us with a minimum funding
level for the initial business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NASDAQ rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering or (B) with
respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to cash
requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

payable by us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $8,300,000
from this offering if the minimum offering is sold and approximately $17,700,000
if the maximum offering is sold, and assuming the underwriter’s
over-subscription option, consisting of 600,000 Class A ordinary shares at a
price of $5.00 per share (up to $3,000,000 of net proceeds) is not exercised.
The net proceeds from this offering must be remitted to China before we will be
able to use the funds to grow our business.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily for general corporate
purposes, which may include establishment of new branch companies and sales
offices, expansion of existing branch companies, investment in product research
and development, sales and marketing activities, technology infrastructure,
capital expenditures and corporate purposes including working capital needs.
Currently, potential cities for new branches under consideration include
Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing and Chongqing. We may also establish new branch
companies in cities we already have a presence. The table below shows how we
intend to use the proceeds in the event of minimum and maximum offering and
assumes the underwriter’s over-allotment option has not been exercised.

In the event that the underwriter’s over-subscription option is exercised, we
intend to use such proceeds (up to $3,000,000) for working capital purposes.

To the extent we raise an amount between the minimum and maximum offering, we
expect that we would allocate amounts in approximately the same percentages. To
the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank
deposits.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to our consolidated variable interest entity only through loans, subject to
the approval of government authorities and limit on the amount of capital
contributions and loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make additional capital
contributions to our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund its capital
expenditures or working capital. For an increase of registered capital of our
wholly foreign-owned subsidiary, we need to file at the PRC Ministry of Commerce
(“MOFCOM”) or its local counterparts. If we provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary through loans, the total amount of such loans may not
exceed the difference between the entity’s total investment as approved by the
foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be
registered with the PRC State Administration of Foreign Exchange (“SAFE”) or its
local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working days to complete. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

from our sale of 15,151,516 shares of our common stock in this offering, based
on the initial public offering price of $18.00 per share, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of 
approximately $16.6 million. If the over-allotment option that we have granted
to the underwriters is exercised in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to
us will be approximately $304.8 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, which will include repaying indebtedness under our 2020 Notes as set
forth below:

The 2020 Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to LIBOR plus a margin of
7.500% per annum. The 2020 Notes mature on June 15, 2020. We have provided two 
notices to the holders of the 2020 Notes, (a) for redemption of $60.0 million 
aggregate principal amount and (b) for redemption of the remaining $230.0 
million aggregate principal amount, and in the case of (b), subject to
completion of this offering and the closing of an asset-based credit facility on
satisfactory terms. We will redeem the notes at a redemption price of 101.500%
of the principal amount, plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but not including
the redemption date.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholder."

U.S.$185.5 million, or approximately U.S.$214.8 million if the underwriters
exercise their option to buy additional common shares in full, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for (i) the
repayment of approximately U.S.$131.7 million of indebtedness (including
indebtedness of U.S.$66.7 million owed to related parties), plus accrued
interest as of the payment date, and (ii) general corporate purposes, including
funding the equity portion of our capital expenditure programs in existing
concessions, acquiring new or existing concessions and repayment of other
indebtedness.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures for general corporate purposes
will depend on numerous factors, including the amount of cash generated by our
operating subsidiaries, actual disbursements related to our capital expenditure
programs by our operating subsidiaries, and other factors. We do not currently
have any agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions of new
concessions, and we therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds that
may be used for such purpose. Our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. Pending the
use of the net proceeds to us from this offering as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term and long-term
interest-bearing obligations, including government and investment-grade debt
securities and money market funds.

The indebtedness we intend to repay consists of the following:

common stock in this offering will be approximately $16.7 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase
additional shares in this offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $18.0 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholder
pursuant to the exercise by the underwriters of their option to purchase
additional shares of our common stock.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate
future access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We
currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including debt reduction and working capital. We plan to
reduce indebtedness of up to $4,436,082.28 owed pursuant to certain business
loans, including related party debt owed to Kenco, Inc. (beneficially owned by
our director Kenneth Potashner) and Tim Rueth (stockholder), and also a
revolving line of credit with Bank of the West. As of December 1, 2017, the
business loans have an aggregate principal balance of $1,213,618.42 and accrue
interest at rates of 3.8% and 11% per annum, respectively, maturing in 2019. The
revolving line of credit has an outstanding balance of $3,222,463.86 which
accrues at a variable rate of interest, subject to extension upon mutual
agreement of the parties. The indebtedness was used primarily to retire certain
outstanding indebtedness and accounts payable of Magma in connection with
Magma’s acquisition by OSS in July 2016 as well as for short-term borrowings and
working capital purposes. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to
acquire complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However,
we do not have agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions at this
time. Pending the use of proceeds to us from this offering as described above,
we intend to invest the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term and
long-term interest-bearing obligations, including government and
investment-grade debt securities and money market funds.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditure, including expenditure related
to sales and marketing and product development will depend on numerous factors,
including the status of our product development efforts, our sales and marketing
activities, expansion, the amount of cash generated or used by our operations,
competitive pressures and other factors. We therefore cannot estimate the amount
of net proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. As a result, we may
find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds,
and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the application of the
net proceeds from this offering."

approximately $1.14 billion, or approximately $1.31 billion if the underwriters
exercise their overallotment option in full, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions related to this offering and estimated offering
expenses. We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering to the
Operating Partnership, which will use the net proceeds to: (a) pay down $300.0 
million of the indebtedness outstanding under the Revolving Credit Facility; (b)
redeem $268.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second Lien Notes at 
a redemption price of 108% plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of 
redemption; (c) repay $100.0 million of the Term Loan B Facility; and (d) pay 
fees and expenses related to this offering; the remainder of the net proceeds 
will be used for general business purposes. Any proceeds received in connection 
with the exercise by the underwriters of their overallotment option will be used
by the Operating Partnership for general business purposes.

The $766.9 million in aggregate principal amount of 8.0% Second Lien Notes bear
interest at an annual rate of 8.0% per annum and mature on October 15, 2023. We
expect to redeem the $268.4 million in aggregate principal amount of the Second
Lien Notes on or about February 21, 2018. The Second Lien Notes were issued in
October 2017 to certain creditors of CEOC. As of January 1, 2018,
$2,200.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Term Loan B Facility
and $300.0 million of indebtedness was outstanding under the Revolving Credit
Facility. The Term Loan B Facility matures on December 22, 2024 or the date that
is three months prior to the maturity date of the Second Lien Notes, whichever
is earlier (or if the maturity is extended pursuant to the terms of the
agreement, such extended maturity date as determined pursuant thereto), and the
Revolving Credit Facility matures on December 22, 2022. Borrowings under the
Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility initially bear interest
at LIBOR plus 2.25% (approximately 3.76% as of January 1, 2018), provided that
following completion of this offering, the interest rate will be LIBOR plus
2.00%. The Term Loan B Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility were entered
into in December 2017, and we used the proceeds from the Term Loan B Facility
and drawings under the Revolving Credit Facility to refinance a portion of our
outstanding long-term debt.

Certain of the underwriters and/or their respective affiliates own a portion of
the Second Lien Notes for their own account and/or for the accounts of
customers, and therefore will receive a portion of the net proceeds of this
offering. In addition, certain of the underwriters and/or their respective
affiliates are acting as agents, arrangers and/or lenders under the Term Loan B
Facility and the Revolving Credit Facility, and therefore will receive an
additional portion of the net proceeds of this offering."

million, or approximately $78.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full
their option to purchase additional ordinary shares, based upon the initial
public offering price of $12.00 per ordinary share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $26.0 million to fund our planned Phase III clinical trials for
  TWIN for the treatment of acne;
 
• approximately $20.0 million to fund our planned Phase III clinical trials for
  VERED for the treatment of subtype II rosacea; and
 
• the remainder for the preparation and scale-up for our planned Phase III
  clinical program for SIRS-T for the treatment of acne, to fund other research
  and development activities, including the development of our generic product
  candidates, and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty any or all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this
offering, or the amounts, if any, that we will actually spend on the uses set
forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will
vary depending on numerous factors, including our ability to obtain additional
financing, if needed, the progress, cost and results of our pre-clinical and
clinical development programs, and whether we are able to enter into future
product development partnerships and technology license arrangements. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, which may include uses not set forth above, and investors will be
relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this
offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our
business. We do not plan to use any proceeds from this offering for the
repayment of any indebtedness.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government or to hold such proceeds as cash.

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses
and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months. Based on
our current plans, we believe that the anticipated net proceeds from this
offering, together with our existing cash resources, will be sufficient for the
completion of (i) our planned Phase III clinical program for TWIN for the
treatment of acne and (ii) our planned Phase III clinical program for VERED for
the treatment of subtype II rosacea. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect."

We intend to use the proceeds from this offering as follows:

product candidate)                                                       1,500,000

Expenses associated with completing our existing Phase II clinical trial and
commencing a planned Phase I/II clinical trial generally consist of our estimate
of the costs charged to us by MD Anderson or other clinical trial sites to
perform the clinical trials for us. Research and development costs generally
consist of our estimate of the costs associated with contractors and advisors
retained by us to assist us with development of clinical strategies, monitoring
our clinical trials and sites, clinical data analysis and other similar
functions related to our current and planned clinical trials. For this reason,
certain estimated research and development costs, as well as certain estimated
costs to prepare FDA filings, relate to the existing Phase II and planned Phase
I/II trials.

We estimate that we will have sufficient funds to complete our existing Phase II
clinical trial for Oncoprex combined with erlotinib and to initiate a Phase I/II
clinical trial for Oncoprex combined with an immunotherapy. Based on our
estimate that the total cost of a Phase I/II trial for Oncoprex combined with an
immunotherapy to be approximately $5 million, we estimate that we will require
additional financing of at least $3.5 million to complete such a trial, plus an
additional $2 million for working capital to fund our operations during the
pendency of the trial. The timing and costs of clinical trials are difficult to
predict and as such the foregoing estimates may prove to be inaccurate.

We believe the net proceeds of this offering, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, including the remaining proceeds from our recent private
placements, will be sufficient to meet our cash, operational and liquidity
requirements for at least 10 months.

requires an initial cash payment of $25,000 as well as $60,000 due within three
business days after the closing of this offering, and $85,000 for each of the
two subsequent months of service. We have agreed to issue to Invictus Resources,
after the closing of this offering, a warrant exercisable for 50,000 shares with
a term of three years and an exercise price equal to $5.00 per share. The
agreement has a term of three months and we may terminate it at any time after
April 23, 2018.

particular uses for the net proceeds to us from this offering. Accordingly, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of these proceeds. Net
offering proceeds not immediately applied to the uses summarized above will be

foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. The
amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash
generated by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the
net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds differently than as described in this
prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government
registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our
PRC subsidiary or make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiary to
fund its capital expenditures or working capital. There is, in effect, no
statutory limit on the amount of capital contribution that we can make to our
PRC subsidiaries. This is because there is no statutory limit on the amount of
registered capital for our PRC subsidiaries, and we are allowed to make capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries by subscribing for their initial
registered capital and increased registered capital, provided that the PRC
subsidiaries completes the relevant filing and registration procedures. With
respect to loans to the PRC subsidiaries by us, (i) if the relevant PRC
subsidiaries determine to adopt the traditional foreign exchange administration
mechanism, or the Current Foreign Debt mechanism, the outstanding amount of the
loans shall not exceed the difference between the total investment and the
registered capital of the PRC subsidiaries and there is, in effect, no statutory
limit on the amount of loans that we can make to our PRC subsidiaries under this
circumstance since we can increase the registered capital of our PRC
subsidiaries by making capital contributions to them, subject to the completion
of relevant registrations, and the difference between the total investment and
the registered capital will increase accordingly; and (ii) if the relevant PRC
subsidiaries determine to adopt the foreign exchange administration mechanism as
provided in the PBOC Notice No. 9, or the Notice No. 9 Foreign Debt mechanism,
the risk-weighted outstanding amount of the loans, which shall be calculated
based on the formula provided in the PBOC Notice No. 9, shall not exceed 200% of
the net asset of the relevant PRC subsidiary. According to the PBOC Notice
No. 9, after a transition period of one year since the promulgation of the PBOC
Notice No. 9, the PBOC and SAFE will determine the cross-border financing
administration mechanism for the foreign-invested enterprises after evaluating
the overall implementation of the PBOC Notice No. 9. As of the date hereof,
neither PBOC nor SAFE has promulgated and made public any further rules,
regulations, notices or circulars in this regard. It is uncertain which
mechanism will be adopted by PBOC and SAFE in the future and what statutory
limits will be imposed on us when providing loans to our PRC subsidiaries. In
terms of capital contributions, it typically takes about eight weeks to complete
the relevant filings and registrations. In terms of loans, the SAFE registration
process typically takes about four weeks to complete. While we currently see no
material obstacles to completing the filing and registration procedures with
respect to future capital contributions and loans to our PRC subsidiaries, we 
annot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations
or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. It is likely that we will need
to convert some of our net proceeds in U.S. dollars into Renminbi in order to
use as proceeds as contemplated in this section. 

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to hold our net proceeds in demand
deposits or invest them in interest-bearing government securities."

this offering will be approximately $61.6 million, or $71.3 million if the 
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

Seattle Genetics, Inc. has agreed to purchase from us, concurrently with this
offering in a private placement, $5.0 million of shares of our common stock at a
price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Our proceeds from
the concurrent private placement will be $5.0 million. 

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering and
the concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash, cash 
equivalents, and marketable securities, as follows:

• approximately $20 million to advance ACTR087 used in combination with 
  rituximab for adult patients with r/r B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma through the
  completion of our ongoing Phase I clinical trial;                     

• approximately $9 million to fund through 2019 a Phase II clinical trial of
  ACTR087 used in combination with rituximab for adult patients with r/r
  non-Hodgkin lymphoma who received prior CD19 CAR-T therapy;               

• approximately $8 million to advance ACTR707 used in combination with rituximab
  for adult patients with r/r B cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma through the completion
  of our Phase I clinical trial;                             

• approximately $16 million to advance ACTR707 used in combination with 
  trastuzumab through submission of an IND and to fund through 2019 our Phase I
  clinical trial for this product candidate; and                    

• the remainder to develop product candidates in earlier stages of development
  and any additional product candidates that we select, to expand headcount and
  internal capabilities, and for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.                                         

Based on our current plans, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering
and the concurrent private placement, together with our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through at least December 2019.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent 
private placement represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the closing of this offering and the concurrent private placement or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from preclinical studies or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations that we may
enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement.

Pending our use of proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private 
placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital 
preservation instruments, including short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

approximately US$162.7 million, or approximately US$187.7 million if the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts, commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our 
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by 
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately US$48.8 million for upgrade and expansion of our study center
  network and education talent recruitment and training; 

• approximately US$48.8 million for research and development expenditures in
  service offerings and initiatives, curriculum design and data analytics 
  capabilities; and 

• the remainder for working capital optimization and other general corporate
  purposes, including selective investments and acquisitions of education 
  businesses that complement our existing service offerings and/or further
  strengthen our curriculum and teaching material design and technology

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and 
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions and to our variable
interest entities only through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable
government registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company
loans to our PRC subsidiaries or make additional capital contributions to our
PRC subsidiaries to fund their capital expenditures or working capital. For an
increase of registered capital of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary, we need
to file the modification documents with the MOC or its local counterparts within
30 days after resolution on such increase of registered capital is passed. If we
provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary through loans, the total
amount of such loans may not exceed either the cross-border financing risk
weighted balance calculated based on a special formula or the difference between
the entity's total investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities
and its registered capital. Any medium- or long-term loan to be provided by us
to our PRC subsidiaries must be filed and registered with the National
Development and Reform Committee and the SAFE or their local branches. Although
it is expected to take no more than 30 days to complete or receive these
government registrations or approvals after submission of all complete
application documents, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

the public offering price of $11.00 per share.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to further implement
our organic growth in our banking markets and for general corporate purposes. We
have not specifically allocated the amount of net proceeds to us that will be
used for these purposes and our management will have broad discretion over how
these proceeds are used. We are conducting this offering at this time because we
believe that it will allow us to better execute our growth strategy. Although we
may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, evaluate potential
acquisition opportunities for other financial institutions, particularly in
ethnic communities that we believe provide attractive risk-adjusted returns, we
do not have any immediate plans, arrangements or understanding relating to any
acquisitions, nor are we engaged in negotiations with any potential acquisition
targets. The ability to issue publicly-traded stock as consideration may enable
us to opportunistically approach potential transactions.

Likewise, we regularly consider establishing de novo banking locations and
organic growth initiatives within our current and potential new markets.
Approximately $1 million of the proceeds will be used to support our new branch
opening in Santa Clara, California in the first quarter of 2018. We do not have
any other immediate plans, arrangements or understanding relating to the

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering for the
following purposes:
 
• approximately $18.0 million to $20.0 million to advance our lead gene therapy
  product candidate, HMI-102, through preclinical studies and through topline 
  results in a Phase 1/2 clinical trial;

uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or

the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and we
anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete the development of any

efforts, the status of and results from pre-clinical studies and any ongoing

collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
through at least the next two years. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect. We may satisfy our future cash needs through
the sale of equity securities, debt financings, working capital lines of credit,
corporate collaborations or license agreements, grant funding, interest income
earned on invested cash balances or a combination of one or more of these
sources.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the

Baskets to the Custodian or other custodian for trading activities. The Sponsor
will invest the proceeds in Freight Futures and U.S. Treasuries with a maturity
of 397 days or less, cash and/or cash equivalents. When the Fund purchases a
futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the selling FCM on behalf
of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as
security to ensure payment for the obligation at maturity. This deposit is known
as initial margin. The Fund will receive or pay, depending on market movement,
variation margin as the value of the futures position increase or decreases.
Shareholders will not be required to post variation margin. The Sponsor will
invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in U.S.
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral
requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of
assets that are:

. held on deposit with the FCM or another custodian;

. used for other investments; and

. held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

To the extent that the Fund does not invest the proceeds of the offering of the
shares of the Fund in the manner described above on the day such proceeds are
received, such proceeds will be deposited with the Custodian in a non-interest
bearing account. The Fund will invest proceeds from an Authorized Participant’s
purchase of a Creation Basket immediately. It is anticipated that the proceeds
from the sale of the initial Creation Baskets will settle with the Custodian on
the same day as the Fund’s initial investment in Freight Futures, which will be
the first day of trading of the Fund’s shares. Therefore, there will be no time
during which the Fund will hold funds from the sale of Creation Baskets prior to
the commencement of trading.

The assets deposited by the Fund with an FCM as margin must be segregated
pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated funds may be invested
only in instruments approved by the CFTC, which include (i) U.S. government
securities, (ii) municipal securities, (iii) U.S. agency obligations, (iv)
certificates of deposit, (v) commercial paper guaranteed by the U.S. government,
(vi) corporate notes or bonds guaranteed by the U.S. government, and (vii)
interests in money market mutual funds; however, the Sponsor anticipates that
the Fund’s margin deposit assets will be invested only in U.S. Treasuries or
otherwise held as cash and/or cash equivalents.

Approximately 10%-40% of the Fund’s assets are expected to normally be committed
as margin for futures contracts and approximately 60% to 90% of the NAV will be
held to pay current obligations and as reserves in the form of U.S. Treasuries,
cash and/or cash equivalents in segregated accounts with an FCM. However, from
time to time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially
more, or less, than such range. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will
generally be required for Freight Futures based on changes in their value.
Considering the differing requirements for initial payments under futures
contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments,
it is not possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted
as margin or collateral at any given time. The U.S. Treasuries, cash and cash
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available to
meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be
used for the Fund’s benefit. The Sponsor invests the balance of the Fund’s
assets not invested in futures in U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of 397 days or
less, cash and cash equivalents and such funds are available as reserves for
changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase
margin or collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading
positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no
bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for futures contracts will be held in
segregation pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations."

of 397 days or less, cash and/or cash equivalents. When the Fund purchases a
futures contract, the Fund is required to deposit with the selling FCM on behalf
of the exchange a portion of the value of the contract or other interest as
security to ensure payment for the obligation at maturity. This deposit is known
as initial margin. The Fund will receive or pay, depending on market movement,
variation margin as the value of the futures position increase or decreases.
Shareholders will not be required to post variation margin. The Sponsor will
invest the assets that remain after margin and collateral are posted in U.S.
Treasuries, cash and/or cash equivalents. Subject to these margin and collateral
requirements, the Sponsor has sole authority to determine the percentage of
assets that are:

. held on deposit with the FCM or another custodian;

. used for other investments; and

. held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves.

To the extent that the Fund does not invest the proceeds of the offering of the
shares of the Fund in the manner described above on the day such proceeds are
received, such proceeds will be deposited with the Custodian in a non-interest
bearing account. The Fund will invest proceeds from an Authorized Participant’s
purchase of a Creation Basket immediately. It is anticipated that the proceeds
from the sale of the initial Creation Baskets will settle with the Custodian on
the same day as the Fund’s initial investment in Freight Futures, which will be
the first day of trading of the Fund’s shares. Therefore, there will be no time
during which the Fund will hold funds from the sale of Creation Baskets prior to
the commencement of trading.

The assets deposited by the Fund with an FCM as margin must be segregated
pursuant to the regulations of the CFTC. Such segregated funds may be invested
only in instruments approved by the CFTC, which include (i) U.S. government
securities, (ii) municipal securities, (iii) U.S. agency obligations, (iv)
certificates of deposit, (v) commercial paper guaranteed by the U.S. government,
(vi) corporate notes or bonds guaranteed by the U.S. government, and (vii)
interests in money market mutual funds; however, the Sponsor anticipates that
the Fund’s margin deposit assets will be invested only in U.S. Treasuries or
otherwise held as cash and/or cash equivalents.

Approximately 10%-40% of the Fund’s assets are expected to normally be committed
as margin for futures contracts and approximately 60% to 90% of the NAV will be
held to pay current obligations and as reserves in the form of U.S. Treasuries,
cash and/or cash equivalents in segregated accounts with an FCM. However, from
time to time, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially
more, or less, than such range. Ongoing margin and collateral payments will
generally be required for Freight Futures based on changes in their value.
Considering the differing requirements for initial payments under futures
contracts and the fluctuating nature of ongoing margin and collateral payments,
it is not possible to estimate what portion of the Fund’s assets will be posted
as margin or collateral at any given time. The U.S. Treasuries, cash and cash
equivalents held by the Fund will constitute reserves that will be available to
meet ongoing margin and collateral requirements. All interest income will be
used for the Fund’s benefit. The Sponsor invests the balance of the Fund’s
assets not invested in futures in U.S. Treasuries with a maturity of 397 days or
less, cash and cash equivalents and such funds are available as reserves for
changes in margin. All interest income is used for the Fund’s benefit.

An FCM, counterparty, government agency or commodity exchange could increase
margin or collateral requirements applicable to the Fund to hold trading
positions at any time. Moreover, margin is merely a security deposit and has no
bearing on the profit or loss potential for any positions held.

The assets of the Fund posted as margin for futures contracts will be held in
segregation pursuant to the Commodity Exchange Act and CFTC regulations."

approximately $4.5 million after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us and based upon an
initial offering price of $4.00 per ordinary share (excluding any exercise of
the underwriters’ over-allotment option).

Proceeds of this offering in the amount of  $600,000 shall be used to fund an
escrow account for a period of 30 months following the closing date of this
offering, which account shall be used in the event we have to indemnify the
underwriters pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement with the
underwriters.

We plan to use approximately $1.1 million of the net proceeds we will receive
from this offering to expand our marketing activities to reach more potential
borrowers and lenders in China, approximately $1.1 million for development of
our online platform and mobile app and approximately $0.6 million to hire
additional employees to enhance our business structure and management. We plan
to use approximately $1.1 million out of the proceeds to pay the costs and
expenses associated with being a public company. This portion of the offering
proceeds will be immediately available to us following the closing of the
offering as it will not be remitted to China. $600,000 of the net proceeds of
this offering shall be used to fund an escrow account established for purposes
of indemnifying the underwriters of this offering. If and when such funds are 
released from escrow pursuant to the terms thereof, we intend to use such funds
for working capital purposes.

To the extent that a certain portion or all of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering are not immediately applied for the above purposes, we plan to
invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing debt instruments or bank
deposits.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

Approximately $200,000 of the proceeds will be immediately remitted to China
following the completion of this offering to fund the registered capital of the
WFOE. Except that, in using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted
under PRC laws and regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding
to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital
contributions and to our consolidated variable interest entities only through
loans, subject to the approval of government authorities and limit on the amount
of capital contributions and loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable
government registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company
loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make additional capital
contributions to our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund its capital
expenditures or working capital. For an increase of registered capital of our
wholly foreign-owned subsidiary, we need to obtain approval from the MOFCOM or
its local counterparts, which will decide within 90 days after receiving the
application. If we provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary
through loans, the total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference
between the entity’s total investment as approved by the foreign investment
authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be registered with SAFE
or its local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working days to complete. We
cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations
or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

approximately $9.8 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and the offering expenses payable by us and based upon an assumed
initial offering price of $4.00 per share (excluding any exercise of the
underwriters’ over-allotment option).

Proceeds of this offering in the amount of $1,200,000 shall be used to fund an
escrow account for a period of 18 months following the closing date of this
offering, which account shall be used in the event we have to indemnify the
underwriters pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement with the
underwriters.

We plan to use the net proceeds we will receive from this offering for business
development, technology development, new hires, as well as for general working
capital purposes. Specifically, we intend to use approximately $4.9 million
(50%) of net proceeds on developing technologies that are essential to expanding
our business, including risk management system, lending mobile application and
business operation management system, approximately $3.92 million (40%) on
marketing and promotion and approximately $0.98 million (10%) on hiring
additional employees. 85% of the net proceeds from this offering will be used by
Sichuan Senmiao and the rest of the net proceeds will be used by us for the
above discussed purposes.

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
owned subsidiary in China through capital contributions and/or loans, subject to
the approval of and/or filing with government authorities and limit on the
amount of capital contributions and loans.

Subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval/filing requirements, we may make additional capital contributions or
extend inter-company loans to our wholly owned subsidiary in China to fund its
capital expenditures or working capital. We intend to increase the registered
capital of the WFOE to $6,000,000 and its total approved investment amount to
$15,000,000. Upon approvals of such increases, $6,000,000 of the offering
proceeds will be remitted to the WFOE as the capital contributions and
$2,600,000 of the offering proceeds will be loaned by us to the WFOE.

We currently anticipate financing our subsidiary by means of capital
contributions and using a portion of the net proceeds from this offering. The
WFOE’s current registered capital is RMB 1,000,000 (approximately US$158,770).
The increase in registered capital and total investment amount will require
(i) filing with MOFCOM and (ii) registration with SAIC to alter WFOE’s business
license to reflect the increase in registered capital, or each of the foregoing
agencies’ respective local counterparts. This approval process typically takes
30 to 90 days in total, and sometimes longer. Other than procedural requirements
disclosed above and certain ratio requirements discussed below, there are no
limit for increasing registered capital under current PRC laws and regulations.

If we provide funding to the WFOE through loans, the total amount of such loans
may not exceed the difference between the WFOE’s total investment as approved by
the foreign investment authorities and its registered capital. The WFOE’s
current registered capital and total approved investment are both RMB 1,000,000
(approximately US$158,770). As discussed above, following this offering, we
intend to increase the registered capital of the WFOE to $6,000,000 and its
total approved investment amount to $15,000,000. In connection with the
increases of WFOE’s registered capital and total approved investment, the ratio
of the total approved investment amount and the registered capital must meet
certain quantitative standards under the Interim Provisions of the State
Administration for Industry and Commerce on the Ratio of the Registered Capital
to the Total Investment of a Sino-Foreign Equity Joint Venture Enterprise.
Pursuant to such regulation, if the total approved investment of the WFOE is
increased to $15 million, the WFOE’s registered capital should be 2/5 of the
total approved investment (or $6 million). In terms of procedure, loans made to
the WFOE by us must be registered with SAFE or its local branches, which usually
takes up to 20 working days to complete. If needed, we plan to extend loans to
the WFOE at an annual interest of 1% for a term of one to three year(s) which we
will determine at the time of extending the loan.

Among the $8.33 million proceeds to be remitted to the WFOE, a certain portion
will be further remitted to Sichuan Senmiao for further expansions of its
business operations. We also plan to transfer a major portion of our research
and development and marketing functions from Sichuan Senmiao to the WFOE after
the closing of this offering. The proceeds not remitted to Sichuan Senmiao will
be used for expanding these functions.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve and change. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures, specifically with respect to working capital,
may vary significantly depending on numerous factors. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering."

(3) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the      
    proceeds of a loan from our sponsor of up to $250,000 that we may draw down  
    as described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of 
    this offering out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds that has been         
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting       
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in  
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital   
    expenses.                                                                    

(4) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 4.0% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment  
    option is exercised, 6.0% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment will 
    be deposited in the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon 
    completion of our initial business combination, up to $6,000,000, which      
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up to $7,350,000 if
    the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid
    to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, and the
    remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a
    portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. Based on the  
    current interest rate environment, we would expect approximately $2,100,000  
    per year of interest to be earned on the funds held in the trust account
    over such period, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This        
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.4% per annum based upon current
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.                    

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

(7) Represents the first year of payments under the Administrative Services      
    Agreement.                                                                   

(8) Represents the first year of payments to our Chief Investment Officer.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering, the sale of the private placement
warrants and the sponsor loan, $151,500,000 (or $174,225,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$6,000,000 (or up to $7,350,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions and $1,500,000 (or
$1,750,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
sponsor loans, will be placed in a U.S. -based trust account, with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$2,100,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.4% per year. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds
from this offering, the sale of the private placement warrants and the sponsor
loan will not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the
completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our
public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’
rights or pre-initial business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of
100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject to
applicable requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If the entire purchase price of our initial business combination is
paid for using stock or debt securities, or if not all of the funds released
from the trust account are used for payment of the consideration in connection
with our business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released
from the trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance
or expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay our sponsor, an affiliate of our Executive Chairman and our Chief
Executive Officer, a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $226,040 of up to
$250,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is
non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of June 30, 2018 or
the closing of this offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $600,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of
our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may
be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts (including accrued interest, if any) out of the proceeds of
the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $2,000,000 of
such loans (including the sponsor loan, at our sponsor’s discretion) may be
convertible into warrants of the post-business combination entity at a price of
$1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. Except for the sponsor loan
warrants, which would be identical to the warrants included in the units sold in
this offering except that they will be non-redeemable and exercisable on a
cashless basis so long as they are held by the sponsor or its permitted
transferees, the warrants issued upon conversion of such loans would be
identical to the private placement warrants. Other than the sponsor loan, no
written agreements currently exist with respect to such loans.

Our anchor investor has committed, pursuant to a forward purchase contract with
us, to purchase, in a private placement to occur concurrently with the
consummation of our initial business combination, 1,500,000 at $10.00 per unit,
and 300,000 shares of common stock (which shares will be issued for no
additional consideration and will have the same terms as the founder shares
described herein) for total gross proceeds of $15,000,000. The funds from the
sale of units will be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the
initial business combination or for the combined company’s working capital
needs. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders electing
to redeem their public shares and provides us with a minimum funding level for
the initial business combination or future working capital needs. An
unaffiliated broker-dealer will, upon consummation of our initial business
combination, be paid an aggregate of 3%, or $450,000 in the aggregate, from the
proceeds of the investment by our anchor investor in us, for aggregate net
proceeds to us of $14,550,000.

If the shares of common stock, either held directly or underlying the securities
issued to or held by our anchor investor represent 10.0% or more of our issued
and outstanding common stock at the closing of our initial business combination,
then the size of our anchor investor’s forward purchase contract shall be
reduced, so that it holds (in the aggregate) no more than 9.9% of our issued and
outstanding common stock at the closing of our initial business combination. The
consummation of the purchases pursuant to the forward purchase agreement with
our anchor investor is subject to various closing conditions, including the
anchor investor’s ability to invest in the industry in which our proposed target
business operates pursuant to our anchor investor’s internal written policies.

Our co-anchor investors have also committed, pursuant to a forward purchase
contract with us, to purchase, in a private placement to occur concurrently with
the consummation of our initial business combination, 1,000,000 shares of our
common stock at a purchase price of $10.00 per share and 100,000 additional
shares of our common stock (which additional shares shall be issued for no
additional consideration and otherwise shall have the same terms as the founder
shares described herein) for total gross proceeds of $10,000,000. The funds from
the sale of such shares will be used as part of the consideration to the sellers
in the initial business combination or for the combined company’s working
capital needs. This commitment is independent of the percentage of stockholders
electing to redeem their public shares and provides us with a minimum funding
level for the initial business combination or future working capital needs.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less
than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules)
and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business
combination activity and (iii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we
are unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from
the closing of this offering (subject to applicable requirements of law). In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

stock offered by us in this offering at the initial public offering price of
$16.00 per share, and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $173.1
million, or approximately $199.8 million if the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, to create a public market for our stock and thereby
enable access to the public equity markets for our employees and stockholders,
to obtain additional capital and to increase our visibility in the marketplace.
We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering
primarily for general corporate purposes, including working capital, sales and
marketing activities, research and development, general and administrative
matters and capital expenditures, although we do not currently have any specific
or preliminary plans with respect to the use of proceeds for such purposes. In
addition, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of,
or investment in, technologies, solutions, products or businesses that
complement our business, although we have no present commitments or agreements
to enter into any material acquisitions or investments. We will have broad
discretion over the uses of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending these
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

$108.1 million, or $124.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility and create a public market for our common stock. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $55.0 million to fund the clinical development of AB928 (our 
  dual A2aR/A2bR antagonist) and AB122 (our anti-PD-1 antibody), including  
  potential milestone payments to WuXi Biologics; and

• the remaining proceeds to fund the development of other product candidates in
  our pipeline, including AB680 (our CD73 inhibitor) and AB154 (our anti-TIGIT 
  antibody), our drug discovery and optimization programs, and other general 
  corporate purposes, which may include the hiring of additional personnel, 
  capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company.

With the expected net proceeds from this offering, we believe that our current
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to fund the
clinical development of AB928 and AB122, including our cohort expansion studies,
into 2020. Accordingly, the expected net proceeds from this offering will not be
sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates through regulatory
approval, and we will need to raise substantial additional capital to complete
the development and commercialization of our product candidates.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our preclinical, clinical
and future development activities may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and
results from our ongoing and planned clinical trials, our ability to take
advantage of expedited programs or to obtain regulatory approval for product
candidates, the timing and costs associated with the manufacture and supply of
product candidates for clinical development or commercialization and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we plan to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term interest-bearing investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit
or government securities."

approximately $47.3 million (or approximately $58.4 million if the underwriters

the initial public offering price of $11.75 per share. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
shareholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to support our growth,
including the possibility of making larger loans due to our increased legal
lending limit, and for general corporate purposes, which may include, but is not
limited to, the repayment or refinancing of debt, maintenance of our required
regulatory capital levels and the funding of new branches or potential future
acquisition opportunities. We do not currently have any specific plans for the
net proceeds and do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings
to make any acquisitions or to establish any new branches, other than our
planned branch in St. Paul, Minnesota that we expect to open in the second
quarter of 2018, and our real estate development in St. Louis Park, Minnesota,
which we expect to begin later in 2018, subject to city approval. Our management
will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering, and
the precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds will depend upon
market conditions, among other factors. Until we deploy the proceeds of this
offering for the uses described above, we expect to hold such proceeds in
short-term investments."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our initial stockholders have committed to purchase the private units (for an
aggregate purchase price of $4,000,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. They have also agreed
that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in
part, they will purchase from us an additional number of private units (up to a
maximum of 45,000 private units) at a price of $10.00 per private unit necessary
to maintain in the trust account $10.10 per unit sold to the public in this
offering. These additional private units will be purchased in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private units are identical
to the units sold in this offering subject to certain limited exceptions as
described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we receive from
these purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

$101,000,000, or $116,150,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

Lion Point Capital has also entered into a contingent forward purchase agreement
with us to purchase, in a private placement for aggregate gross proceeds of
$30,000,000, to occur concurrently with the consummation of our initial business
combination, 3,000,000 of our units at $10.00 per unit, on substantially the
same terms as the sale of units in this offering. The funds from the sale of
these units may be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the
initial business combination; any excess funds may be used for the working
capital needs of the post-transaction company. This agreement is independent of
the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their public shares and may
provide us with an increased minimum funding level for the initial business
combination. The contingent forward purchase agreement is subject to conditions,
including Lion Point Capital giving us its irrevocable written consent to
purchase the units no later than five days after we notify them of our intention
to meet to consider entering into a definitive agreement for a proposed business
combination. Lion Point Capital granting its consent to the purchase is entirely
within its sole discretion. Accordingly, if it does not consent to the purchase,
it will not be obligated to purchase the units.

The payment to Axis Management S.A. de C.V. of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Axis Management S.A.
de C.V. for our benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated
officers and directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based
on rents and fees for similar services in the Mexico City metropolitan area,
that the fee charged by Axis Management S.A. de C.V. is at least as favorable as
we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will
terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$10,000 per month fee and the repayment of the $147,839 loan, as of the date of
this prospectus, from Axis Management S.A. de C.V. (none of which payments will
be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to
the completion of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind
will be paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Our
audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to
our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any
interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit
on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to
the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account and interest earned on the funds in the trust account that we are
entitled to withdraw, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate an initial business combination. Since the role of present management
after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital upon
consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection
with our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital stock is 
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business 
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any 
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the 
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ 
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and 
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to advance us the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, an affiliate of our sponsor has advanced and
loaned us an aggregate of $147,839, which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The note
governing the loan is non-interest bearing and is payable on the earlier to
occur of December 31, 2018, the consummation of this offering, or the
abandonment of this offering, while the advances are due upon demand. The
advances and loan will be payable without interest. The advance and loan will be
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of
offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated
to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they
deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial
business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to
$1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per
unit. The units would be identical to the private units. In the event that the
initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working
capital held outside the trust account or interest available to us earned on the
funds in the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but no proceeds from
our trust account other than the interest earned thereon would be used for such
repayment.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their
shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or
affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the
approval of any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director
or director nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

our common stock in this offering will be approximately $54.2 million, based on
the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this offering will be
approximately $62.6 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $25 million to fund BXCL501 through Phase 2 clinical development
  and potentially one registration trial;

• approximately $17 million to fund BXCL701 through Phase 2 clinical 
  development;

• $1 million to be reimbursed to BioXcel pursuant to the Contribution Agreement;

• $.88 million to be repaid to BioXcel purusant to the Services Agreement and 
  Grid Note; and

• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash
equivalents and investments will be sufficient to fund our current operations
for at least twelve months from the date of this prospectus. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our 
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. We believe the 
amount of net proceeds from this offering currently allocated to BXCL501 and
BXCL701 will be sufficient to fund those programs through Phase 2 clinical
development. We will need to raise substantial additional funds to complete
registration trials for both BXCL501 and BXCL701 and before we can expect to
commercialize any products, if approved. As of the date of this prospectus, we
believe we will need approximately $25 million and $40 million to complete
registration trials for each indication of BXCL501 and BXCL701, respectively,
assuming no accelerated approval pathways are received. We may satisfy our
future cash needs through the sale of equity securities, debt financings,
working capital lines of credit, corporate collaborations or license agreements,
grant funding, interest income earned on invested cash balances or a combination
of one or more of these sources. The amount and timing of our actual 
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the status and results
of our planned Phase 2 PoC open label clinical trials in 2018 for both BXCL501
and BXCL701. Furthermore, we anticipate that we will need to secure additional
funding for the further development of BXCL501 and BXCL701, and for the
development of any of our other product candidates.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering, our existing cash and
cash equivalents and the amounts we believe we will need to complete 
registration trials for BXCL501 and BXCL701 represents our intentions based upon
our current plans, financial condition and business conditions. Predicting the
cost necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and the amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on 
numerous factors, including the progress of our development and 
commercialization efforts, the status of and results from clinical trials, any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering and our existing cash and cash equivalents.

In the ordinary course of our business, we expect to from time to time evaluate
the acquisition of, investment in or in-license of complementary products, 
technologies or businesses, and we could use a portion of the net proceeds from
this offering for such activities. We currently do not have any agreements,
arrangements or commitments with respect to any potential acquisition, 
investment or license.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest
the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and government
securities.

In connection with the Services Agreement, we entered into the Grid Note with
BioXcel. As of December 31, 2017, we have drawn an amount of $371,000 under the 
Grid Note. The Grid Note is payable upon the earlier of (i) the completion of 
this offering and (ii) December 31, 2018, together with interest on the unpaid
balance of each advance made under the Grid Note, which shall accrue at a rate
per annum equal to the applicable federal rate for short-term loans as of the 
date hereof, in each case calculated based on a 365-day year and actual days 
elapsed. We have also agreed to reimburse BioXcel for its contributed services
and support to us in connection with our organization and development prior to
the date of the Grid Note in the amount of $562,000 of which $122,000 has been
repaid as of December 31, 2017 which amount shall be payable upon the earlier of
(i) thirty days after the completion of this offering and (ii) December 31,
2018."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $435.4 
million, or approximately $524.6 million if the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, based on the initial public offering price of 
$29.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined with
certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes. Such purposes are expected
to include additional investments in extending and enhancing our technology
platform, expanding our direct sales force and customer success team and related
expenditures to drive new customer adoption, expanding use cases and vertical
solutions, and supporting international expansion and our developer community.

We also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
satisfy tax withholding and remittance obligations when we settle our RSUs
granted prior to the date of this prospectus, as well as those granted after the
date of this prospectus, which will begin to vest after the completion of this
offering with respect to any then-outstanding RSUs subject to a
performance-based condition tied to a liquidity event requirement, which will be
satisfied on the effective date of this offering. We do not currently know the
amount of net proceeds that would be used to satisfy these tax withholding
obligations because it depends on many factors, including (1) the price of
shares of our common stock on the settlement date, and (2) the actual number of
RSUs outstanding for which the service condition has been fully satisfied. Based
on 12,088,650 RSUs outstanding as of April 11, 2018 for which the service
condition is expected to be satisfied on or before December 14, 2018 (the day
before December 15, 2018, which is the third quarterly settlement date following
this offering if this offering occurs before June 15, 2018), and assuming (1)
the performance condition had been satisfied on that date and (2) that the price
of our common stock at the time of settlement was equal to the initial public
offering price of $29.00, we estimate that this tax obligation on the initial
settlement date would be approximately $132.2 million in the aggregate. A $1.00
increase in the price of our common stock at the time of settlement from the
initial public offering price of $29.00 per share, assuming no change to the
applicable tax rates, would increase the amount we would be required to pay to
satisfy these tax withholding obligations by approximately $4.8 million. A $1.00
decrease in the price of our common stock at the time of settlement from the
initial public offering price of $29.00 per share, assuming no change to the
applicable tax rates, would decrease the amount we would be required to pay to
satisfy these tax withholding obligations by approximately $4.8 million. The
foregoing discussion does not include settlement of up to 11,646,000 shares of
common stock issuable from time to time upon the settlement of RSUs outstanding
as of April 11, 2018 for which the service condition is not expected to be
satisfied on December 14, 2018.

We may also use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or
strategic investments in businesses or technologies, although we do not
currently have any commitments for any such acquisitions or investments.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short-and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, and government
securities."

million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately
$6 million, assuming the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of 
Class A common stock is not exercised. If the underwriters exercise their option
to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full, we expect to 
receive approximately $91 million of net proceeds, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions of approximately $7 million.

We estimate that the offering expenses (other than the underwriting discount and
commissions) will be approximately $4.25 million. All of such offering expenses
will be paid for or otherwise borne by Goosehead Insurance, Inc.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay the Goosehead
Management Note and the Texas Wasatch Note in consideration for the acquisition
of the indirect ownership interests held by the Goosehead Management Holders and
Texas Wasatch Holders in Goosehead Management, LLC and Texas Wasatch Insurance
Holdings Group, LLC, respectively. The aggregate principal amount of the
Goosehead Management Note and the Texas Wasatch Note will be collectively equal
to approximately $114 million. The net proceeds of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A
common stock) are insufficient to repay the Goosehead Management Note and the
Texas Wasatch Note in full. As a result, we will issue 3,723,767 shares of Class
A common stock to the Goosehead Management Holders and the Texas Wasatch Holders
for the difference valued at the public offering price of $10.00 per share of
the Class A common stock in this offering. In exchange for the acquired
ownership interest in Goosehead Management, LLC and Texas Wasatch Insurance
Holdings Group, LLC, wholly owned subsidiaries of Goosehead Insurance, Inc. will
acquire a number of LLC Units equal to the number of shares of Class A common
stock issued in this offering from Goosehead Financial, LLC. Goosehead

the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock
to purchase from Goosehead Financial, LLC a number of LLC Units equal to the
number of shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to the exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares. In turn, we intend to cause
Goosehead Financial, LLC to use the proceeds it receives for general corporate
purposes, which may include the repayment of debt."

Class A common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately
$117.9 million, based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $13.00
per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range set forth on the
cover page of this prospectus, and after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’
option to purchase additional shares to cover over-allotments is exercised in
full, we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately $139.0 million,
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares of our Class A common stock by the selling shareholders.

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$13.00 per share, which is the midpoint of the offering price range set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus, would increase or decrease, as applicable,
the net proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $9.3
million, assuming that the number of shares of Class A common stock offered by
us, as set forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions. Similarly,
each increase or decrease of one million in the number of shares of Class A
common stock offered by us would increase or decrease, as applicable, the net
proceeds that we receive from this offering by approximately $12.1 million,
assuming that the assumed initial public offering price remains the same and
after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock, and
facilitate future access to the public equity markets for us and our
shareholders. While we have no specific plans at this time, we may use some of
the proceeds that we will receive from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including expanding our headcount and funding
our growth strategies to scale with our business through sales and marketing
activities, technology and product development, general and administrative
matters, investing in hardware for our data center operations, international
expansion, building out our office facilities, and other capital expenditures.

private placement to redeem the $475.0 million principal amount of our
outstanding 11% Senior Notes due 2021 as well as to pay a portion of the
interest on the Senior Notes that will have accrued at the time of the

allocation of the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement based upon our present plans and business conditions, but our

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including to increase capital levels to support further organic
growth, including the planned opening of two new banking centers in 2019 and
2020, and, potentially, to fund future acquisitions. We do not have any current
plans, arrangements, or understandings to make any acquisitions at this time. We
estimate that the cost to open each new banking center will be approximately
$750 thousand. We do not have any current specific plan for such remaining net
proceeds, and do not have any current plans, arrangements or understandings to
make any acquisitions. Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate
the net proceeds of this offering. The precise amounts and timing of our use of

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock and facilitate
our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the net 
proceeds of this offering for working capital and other general corporate 
purposes, including continued investments in the growth of our business. 
In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for investments in or
acquisitions of businesses, technologies or other assets that we believe to be
complementary. We do not have any existing agreements or commitments for any 
specific investments or acquisitions. We do not intend to transfer any net
proceeds we receive from this offering to Dell Technologies, Dell or their
respective affiliates, other than payments in the ordinary course of business
under one or more of the agreements.

intentions based on our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict
with certainty all of the particular uses for such proceeds or the amounts that
we actually will spend on the uses specified above. Accordingly, our management
will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering.

The timing and amount of our actual application of the net proceeds from this
offering will be based on many factors, including our cash flows from operations
and the growth of our business. Pending the uses set forth above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds from this offering in a variety of investments, 
including short-term and intermediate-term, interest-bearing securities.

this offering will be approximately $108.8 million, or $123.9 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, based
on the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. The net proceeds from the concurrent private placement will be
$11.5 million.

Novartis Institutes for Biomedical Research, Inc. has agreed to purchase from
us, concurrently with this offering in a private placement, 766,666 shares of
common stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
received by us in this offering and the concurrent private placement, together
with our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as follows:

• approximately $50.0 million to advance SRF231 through initial Phase 1 clinical
  trial results, which are expected in the first half of 2019;     

• approximately $35.0 million for ongoing research and development activities
  related to our other product candidates and additiona programs, including
  advancing SRF617 and SRF388 through IND-enabling studies; and

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, which 
  will include hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and the
  costs of operating as a public company.                           

Based on our current plans, we believe that the anticipated net proceeds from
this offering and the concurrent private placement, together with our existing
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, will be sufficient to fund our
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next
24 months.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the completion of this offering and the concurrent private placement or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies or
clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as our existing
collaboration with Novartis and any other collaborations that we may enter into
with third parties for our current or future product candidates or business
development opportunities we may engage in for our programs and any unforeseen
cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments, which include corporate,
financial institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations."

million after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase additional ADSs, we estimate that the net proceeds of the
offering will be approximately $218.9 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with a portion of
our cash and cash equivalents, available-for-sale financial assets, and current
financial assets classified as loans and receivables (in aggregate of €312.2
million as of December 31, 2017) to continue the development of our proprietary
clinical pipeline, initiate pre-commercial and commercial activities and to
advance earlier stage product candidates in particular, in order of priority, as
follows:

· Approximately $225 million for the continuation and further development of
  MOR208, our wholly-owned anti-CD19 antibody currently being evaluated in r/r
  DLBCL (a) in combination with lenalidomide for patients ineligible for HDCT
  and ASCT, (b) in combination with bendamustine for patients ineligible for
  HDCT and ASCT, and (c) in CLL in combination with either idelalisib or
  venetoclax in patients who have relapsed after prior therapy with a Bruton’s
  tyrosine kinase inhibitor;

· Approximately $90 million to build our commercial capabilities in connection
  with the potential future approval of MOR208;

· Approximately $20 million for the financing of clinical development of MOR202
  (in MM and in NSCLC in combination with a checkpoint inhibitor) and
  approximately $30 million for the clinical development of MOR106 (in atopic
  dermatitis); and

· Approximately $45 million for discovery programs and the development of our
  technology platforms.

We expect to use the remainder of any net proceeds from the offering as well as
existing cash and cash equivalents for general corporate purposes. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in
complementary technologies, products, businesses or assets, either alone or
together with a collaboration partner. However, we have no current plans,
commitments or obligations to do so.

With the net proceeds from this offering as well as our other available sources
of liquidity, we expect (a) in respect of MOR208, to be able to complete BLA
submissions for our L-MIND and B-MIND trials and to reach primary completion in
our L-MIND study, (b) in respect of MOR202, to conduct a Phase 1/2 trial in
NSCLC and to complete the current Phase 1/2a in MM, and (c) in respect of
MOR106, to conduct a Phase 2 trial in AD. Our expected use of the net proceeds
from this offering represents our current expectations of our funding needs in
respect of those uses through 2020, based upon our present plans, business
conditions and expectations for further clinical development, each of which
could change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. After
2020, we expect that there will be continued clinical trial costs associated
with MOR202 and our earlier stage product candidates, in particular MOR106, as
well as costs associated with the commercialization of MOR208, though we cannot
estimate these costs with certainty. As of the date of this prospectus, we
cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to
be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will
specifically spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the ongoing status of
and results from our clinical trials and pre-clinical studies, our ability to
obtain regulatory approvals in respect of our product candidates, changes in the
competitive landscape, management decisions to work together with collaboration
partners, the level and timing of milestones and royalty payments received, and
any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering and investors will be
relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering. In addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical
trials or pre-clinical activities if the net proceeds from this offering and our
other sources of cash are less than expected.

Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in a
variety of capital preservation investments, including money market deposits and
investment funds that will be designated as financial assets at fair value
through profit and loss in our consolidated statement of financial position."

(1) The use of proceeds was calculated based on the following considerations

(i) We plan to expand our technology development team to recruit additional 10 
    to 20 mid-level or high-level personnel and control the cost at about 
    RMB300,000 (approximately $42,800) per year per person;                                 

(ii) We plan to purchase two new core trading platforms, which will incur a      
     purchase expense of $150,000 to $200,000 and a monthly fee of $20,000 to    
     $30,000. Other expenses include purchasing hardware servers and database    
     applications for the more professional and multi-assets trading platform, 
     in a total of approximately $200,000 per year. Once our customer base 
     expands, we will incur an increase in monthly fee regarding expanding the 
     current system and purchasing additional core trading platform. Currently,
     we incur a monthly cost of approximately $30,000 on the web service cost 
     and software used on our existing trading platform.   

(iii) We plan to recruit more sales and marketing personnel to broaden our       
      international market and client base. We also plan to open office in       
      Malaysia and Australia. We intend to recruit about 15 additional employees 
      in the three offices with an annual salary of $30,000 to $50,000 per 
      person on average.  

(iv) We plan to retain an in-house counsel and 3 to 4 senior compliance officers 
     with an annual salary of about $50,000 per person.

(v) We plan to spend more in marketing, including online advertisement,     
    promotion, digital marketing, and exhibition. We aim to maintain the live
    client acquisition cost within $300 per client. And we expect to run 
    marketing plan to acquire approximately 4,000 potential clients.    

(vi) We plan to rent more office space, which would incur an expense for about   
     RMB200,000 (or approximately $30,000) per month and RMB2,500,000 (or        
     approximately $360,000) per year in rent.                                   

(vii) Our daily operating expense will increase based on the more active         
      operating activities.  

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our Class A Ordinary Shares. It is possible that we may
become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers,
which could result in negative tax consequences to you."

    to 20 mid-level or high-level personnel and control the cost at about 
    RMB300,000 (approximately $42,800) per year per person;                                 

(ii) We plan to purchase two new core trading platforms, which will incur a      
     purchase expense of $150,000 to $200,000 and a monthly fee of $20,000 to    
     $30,000. Other expenses include purchasing hardware servers and database    
     applications for the more professional and multi-assets trading platform, 
     in a total of approximately $200,000 per year. Once our customer base 
     expands, we will incur an increase in monthly fee regarding expanding the 
     current system and purchasing additional core trading platform. Currently,
     we incur a monthly cost of approximately $30,000 on the web service cost 
     and software used on our existing trading platform.   

(iii) We plan to recruit more sales and marketing personnel to broaden our       
      international market and client base. We also plan to open office in       
      Malaysia and Australia. We intend to recruit about 15 additional employees 
      in the three offices with an annual salary of $30,000 to $50,000 per 
      person on average.  

(iv) We plan to retain an in-house counsel and 3 to 4 senior compliance officers 
     with an annual salary of about $50,000 per person.

(v) We plan to spend more in marketing, including online advertisement,     
    promotion, digital marketing, and exhibition. We aim to maintain the live
    client acquisition cost within $300 per client. And we expect to run 
    marketing plan to acquire approximately 4,000 potential clients.    

(vi) We plan to rent more office space, which would incur an expense for about   
     RMB200,000 (or approximately $30,000) per month and RMB2,500,000 (or        
     approximately $360,000) per year in rent.                                   

(vii) Our daily operating expense will increase based on the more active         
      operating activities.  

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our Class A Ordinary Shares. It is possible that we may
become a passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers,
which could result in negative tax consequences to you."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    received from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds that have been allocated for the payment of offering expenses 
    (other than underwriting commissions) and proceeds not to be held in the 
    trust account. In the event the offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital 
    expenses. In the event the offering expenses are more than set forth in this
    table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(2) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these   
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may    
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in    
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination 
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not   
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

(3) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

$300,000,000, or $345.0 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full, of net proceeds of this offering will be placed in a U.S. based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in
trust will be invested only in United States “government securities” within the
meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to
(i) interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay
our income or other tax obligations, (ii) any remaining interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account released to us for payment of $10,000 per month
to our sponsor or one of its affiliates for up to 18 months for office space,
utilities and secretarial and administrative support and (iii) up to $50,000
earned on the funds in the trust account we may need to pay for our liquidation
expenses if we are unable to consummate an initial business combination within
the required time period, the proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment of $10,000 per month to our sponsor or one of its affiliates, for up
to 18 months, is for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit and
is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated officers and directors with
compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation. Other than
the payment of $10,000 per month to our sponsor or one of its affiliates, for up
to 18 months, for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
support (which payments may be made from the interest on the proceeds of this
offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial
business combination), and the repayment of a loan in an aggregate amount of up
to $200,000 from our sponsor (which repayment will not be made from the proceeds
of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our
initial business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our
sponsor, officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial
business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is).
However, such entity and individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our sponsor, officers, 
directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested director 
abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the amount of 
such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, to the extent such expenses
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such expenses
would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial business 
combination. Since the role of present management after a business combination 
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$1,000,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and legal, accounting and similar public company costs, with the balance being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our sponsor,
officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described
below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such proceeds
within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to Oppenheimer & Co. Inc. and
EarlyBirdCapital equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering
(exclusive of any applicable finders’ fees which might become payable) upon
consummation of our initial business combination for assisting us in connection
with our initial business combination. To the extent our capital stock is used
in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the 
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business 
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the 
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ 
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from the up to $50,000 of interest that may be released
to us from the trust account to pay for our liquidation and dissolution
expenses. If such interest is insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to advance us
the funds necessary to complete such liquidation and has agreed not to seek
repayment of such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to an
aggregate of $200,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, the
FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable
without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering
expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, to meet
our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering, our 
sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, 
from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable in 
their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The 
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business 
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of 
the notes may be converted into  warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. In 
the event the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion
of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned 
amounts, but no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such 
repayment.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would affect our public stockholders’ ability to convert or sell their
shares to us in connection with a business combination as described herein or
affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete a business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the
approval of any such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation, whether proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer, director
or director nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a

stock in this offering will be approximately $138.9 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised
in full, we estimate that the net proceeds would be approximately $160.4 
million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock,
enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders, increase
awareness of our company, and improve our competitive position. We intend to use
the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales
and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, and capital
expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or
acquire complementary businesses, products, services, technologies, or other
assets. However, we do not have any agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions or investments at this time.

We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds that we
receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using
these proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds. Pending their use, we plan to invest
the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

Units in this offering will be approximately $6.7 million (or approximately $7.8
million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional Units
in full), based upon an assumed initial public offering price of $7.00 per Unit,
which is the mid-point of the price range set forth on the cover page of this
Prospectus, and after deducting $800,000 in estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and $485,942 of estimated offering expenses payable by us.

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price of
$7.00 per Unit, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on the cover
page of this Prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, would increase or
decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to us from this offering by
approximately $1.0 million, assuming the number of Units offered by us, as set
forth on the cover page of this Prospectus, remains the same. We may also
increase or decrease the number of Units we are offering. Each increase or
decrease of 100,000 Units we are offering at the assumed initial public offering
price of $7.00 per Unit, which is the midpoint of the price range set forth on
the cover page of this Prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, would
increase or decrease, as applicable, the net proceeds to us from this offering
by approximately $630,000, assuming the assumed initial public offering price
remains the same.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. approximately $1.5 million to fund our research and development activities;   
                                                                            
. approximately $4.25 million to fund the regulatory review process for all     
  three of our product candidates; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,       
  including the additional costs associated with being a public company.        

In addition, on May 15, 2018, we issued five promissory notes in connection with
the May Bridge Notes financing for an aggregate principal balance amount of
$850,000 and, in connection, issued 55,000 shares of our common stock.

We issued the first note as part of the May Bridge Notes in the principal amount
of $300,000 and 15,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash proceeds of
$250,000. This note has no stated interest rate, and is due on earlier of (1) 90
days from the date of issuance, or (2) the consummation of this offering.

We issued the second note as part of the May Bridge Notes in the principal
amount of $300,000 and 15,000 shares of our common stock for aggregate cash
proceeds of $250,000. This note bears interest at 10%, and is due on earlier of
(1) 90 days from the date of issuance, or (2) the consummation of this offering.

We issued the remaining three notes as part of the May Bridge Notes in the
aggregate principal amount of $250,000 and an aggregate of 25,000 shares of our
common stock for aggregate cash proceeds of $250,000. These notes bear interest
at 10% per annum, and are due on earlier of (1) 90 days from the date of
issuance, or (2) the consummation of this offering. These notes are secured by
substantially all of our assets.

The proceeds from the May Bridge Notes were used for working capital purposes,
including a portion of the expenses of this offering. We intend to use a portion
of the net proceeds from this offering to repay all of the principal and accrued
interest on the May Bridge Notes in full. 

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, our sales, marketing and manufacturing efforts, any
collaboration that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in-license of complementary product
candidates. While we have no current agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds for these purposes.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received as loans from our insiders described below. These funds will be
    repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) The funds held in the trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our
    expenses relating to completing our initial business combination, including
    a deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC
    in an amount equal to 2.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the
    offering described below.

(4) In the event that the over-allotment option is exercised in full, working
    capital for miscellaneous expenses will be $1,073,750.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business
    combination. We do not anticipate any change in the categories of our
    intended use of proceeds.

Certain of our stockholders have committed that they will purchase the private
units (for an aggregate purchase price of $11,500,000) from us on a private
placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. All of
the proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$178,500,000, or $205,275,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in a trust account in the United States at Morgan Stanley Bank, N.A.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in the trust account will be invested only in United States government
treasury bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in U.S.
treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or other tax
obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our redemption
of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a business
combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete our initial business combination to the extent not used to pay
converting stockholders. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of
the target business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to VK Consulting, Inc., a company owned by Vadim Komissarov, one of
our officers, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. However,
pursuant to the terms of such agreement, we may delay payment of such monthly
fee upon a determination by our audit committee that we lack sufficient funds
held outside the trust to pay actual or anticipated expenses in connection with
our initial business combination. Any such unpaid amount will accrue without
interest and be due and payable no later than the date of the consummation of
our initial business combination. This arrangement is being agreed to by VK
Consulting, Inc. for our benefit. We believe that the fee charged by VK
Consulting, Inc. is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month fee, no compensation of any
kind (including finder’s fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation)
will be paid to our insiders, members of our management team or any of our or
their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Since
the role of present management after our initial business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after our initial business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $2,687,500 (or $1,506,250 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full).

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our insiders, members of our management
team or third parties, but our insiders, members of our management team or third
parties are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, in connection with our initial
business combination and to pay our expenses relating thereto, including the
deferred underwriting commission payable to Chardan Capital Markets, LLC in an
amount equal to 2.5% of the total gross proceeds raised in the offering upon
consummation of our initial business combination. To the extent that our capital
stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial
business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used
to consummate a business combination will be disbursed to the combined company
and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working
capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital
funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the
target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing,
research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our insiders have agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses.

In March 2016, VK Consulting, Inc. loaned us $425,000 to be used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
the SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the
Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and accounting fees and expenses.
The loans are payable without interest on the consummation of a business
combination.

In October 2017, Edward S. Verona, one of our directors, loaned us $100,000 to
cover expenses related to this offering. The loan is payable without interest on
the earlier of (i) the consummation of the this offering or (ii) the date on
which the Company determines not to proceed with this offering.

In February 2018, (i) Atidan Ventures, LLC, one of our stockholders, loaned to
us $100,000 to cover expenses related to this offering, and (ii) FLOCO Ventures,
LLC, one of our stockholders, loaned us $200,000 to cover expenses related to
this offering. The loans are payable without interest on the earlier of (i) the
consummation of this offering or (ii) the date on which the Company determines
not to proceed with this offering.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for up to the next 18 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our insiders, officers and directors (and/or their designees)
may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time,
in whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan
would be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $200,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit. Our stockholders have approved the issuance of the
private units upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to
so convert such notes at the time of the consummation of our initial business
combination. If we do not complete a business combination, any loans and
advances from our insiders, officers and directors or their affiliates, will be
repaid only from amounts remaining outside our trust account, if any.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only in the event of (1) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period, (2)
if that public stockholder elects to convert public shares in connection with a
stockholder vote or (3) if that public stockholder sells shares to us in any
tender offer in connection with a proposed business combination. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

offering price of $13.00 per share, after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option to purchase additional
ordinary shares from us, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately
$82.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available borrowing under
our credit facility, as follows:

• approximately $65.0 million to fund our Phase 3 clinical trials of oral
  sulopenem and sulopenem in three indications;

• approximately $15.0 million for milestone payments to Pfizer Inc. payable upon
  commencement of Phase 3 clinical development for oral sulopenem and sulopenem
  pursuant to the exclusive license agreement we have entered into with Pfizer;
  and                                                          

• the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  including regulatory, manufacturing, clinical supply and related costs.

We believe the anticipated net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments and available borrowing
under our credit facility, will enable us to complete our three planned Phase 3
clinical trials. However, we expect that we will require additional capital to
submit our applications to regulatory agencies and to commercialize oral
sulopenem and sulopenem, if we receive regulatory approval.

The expected use of proceeds from this offering represent our intentions based
upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

Class A common shares in this offering will be approximately $138.1 million (or
$159.4 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase 
additional Class A common shares), based on the initial public offering price of
$18.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, as follows:

• approximately $30.0 million to $35.0 million to complete our ongoing Phase 2
  proof-of-concept clinical trial of rilonacept for the treatment of
  pericarditis and, if the results from this trial are favorable, to initiate
  and advance our planned Phase 3 development of rilonacept;

• approximately $65.0 million to $70.0 million to initiate and advance our
  planned Phase 2 clinical trial of mavrilimumab for the treatment of GCA;

• approximately $80.0 million to $85.0 million to complete our ongoing Phase
  1a/1b clinical trial of KPL-716 in subjects with atopic dermatitis as a
  proof-of-concept for pruritic conditions and, if the results from the trial
  are favorable, advance the clinical development of KPL-716 for the treatment
  of prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis; and

• the remainder to fund new and ongoing research and development activities,
  including to advance the pre-clinical development of KPL-045 and KPL-404, and
  for working capital and other general corporate activities.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering or the actual amounts
that we will spend on the uses set forth above. We may also use a portion of the
net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in additional businesses,
technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no specific
agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the
progress of our clinical trials, our ability to obtain marketing approval from
the FDA for our product candidates and other development and commercialization
efforts for our product candidates, as well as the amount of cash used in our
operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds from
this offering for other purposes, and as a result, our management will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

We anticipate that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the
anticipated net proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our
operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements into the second quarter
of 2020, enabling us (i) to complete our ongoing clinical trials, (ii) initiate
and advance our planned Phase 3 development of rilonacept and our planned Phase
2 clinical trial of mavrilimumab and (iii) advance the clinical development of
KPL-716 for the treatment of prurigo nodularis and atopic dermatitis. We have
based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could
utilize our available capital resources sooner than we expect. Following this
offering, we will require substantial capital to complete clinical development,
seek regulatory approval of, and, if approved, commercialize our product
candidates.

Pending the use of the proceeds described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $67.5 million, or
approximately $78.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based upon the initial public offering price
of $14.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities, as follows:

. $35.0 million to fund research and development activities for SRK-015 through
  our planned Phase 2 clinical proof of concept trial;

. $18.0 million to fund TGFß1, BMP6 and other preclinical research and 
  development activities; and

. the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will
be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements into the second half of 2020.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds
to be received upon the completion of this offering. Due to uncertainties
inherent in the product development process, it is difficult to estimate the
exact amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any particular purpose.
We may use our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities and the
future payments, if any, generated from any future collaboration agreements to
fund our operations, either of which may alter the amount of net proceeds used
for a particular purpose. In addition, the amount, allocation and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the results of
our research and development efforts, the timing and success of clinical trials
and the timing of regulatory submissions. Accordingly, we will have broad
discretion in using these proceeds.

Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock) based upon the initial public offering price of $23.00 per
share.

“Redemption proceeds” refers to gross proceeds from this offering, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions, but not other offering
expenses. We intend to use redemption proceeds of approximately $784.1 million
to purchase an aggregate of 35,884,481 Holdco Units from the Exchanging Members.
We also intend to use redemption proceeds of (i) approximately $43.7 million to
redeem 1,999,558 shares of our Class A common stock from equity holders of
certain of the Former Corporate Investors and (ii) approximately $2.5 million to
redeem 115,961 shares of our Class A common stock issued upon exercise of
options by certain option holders.

The purchase price for each Holdco Unit surrendered, and share of Class A common
stock redeemed, will equal the price per share of our Class A common stock in
this offering, less underwriting discounts and commissions.

If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase 5,700,000
additional shares of Class A common stock, in addition to the use of our
proceeds described above, we intend to use the additional redemption proceeds of
approximately $117.8 million from our sale of additional shares to purchase an
additional 5,389,321 Holdco Units (with automatic cancellation of an equal
number of shares of Class B common stock) from the Exchanging Members;
approximately $6.5 million to redeem an additional 301,242 shares of our Class A

approximately $9.09 million, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional common shares is exercised in full, we estimate that we will
receive net proceeds of approximately $1.46 million, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. The net
proceeds exclude the $200,000 of the offering proceeds placed in the
indeminification escrow account.

Proceeds of this offering in the amount of $200,000 shall be used to fund an
indemnification escrow account for a period of 18 months following the closing
date of this offering, which account shall be used in the event we have to
indemnify the underwriters pursuant to the terms of an Underwriting Agreement
with the underwriters.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process (these below-referenced net proceeds amounts do not
include $200,000 of the offering proceeds to be allotted to the indemnification
escrow account to pay for the underwriters’ indemnity):

• Approximately $3.64 million or 40% for global expansion, i.e., to expand our
  existing locations to develop new clients by hiring more qualified personnel,
  system integration and marketing effort;

• Approximately $2.73 million or 30% for working capital and general corporate
  purposes;

• Approximately $1.82 million or 20% for R&D

• Approximately $0.90 million or 10% for talent development.

The precise amounts and percentage of proceeds we would devote to particular
categories of activity will depend on prevailing market and business conditions
as well as particular opportunities that may arise from time to time. This
expected use of our net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including any unforeseen cash needs. Similarly, the priority of our prospective
uses of proceeds will depend on business and market conditions are they develop.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility and broad
discretion in applying the net proceeds of the offering. If an unforeseen event
occurs or business conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering
differently than as described in this prospectus. In utilizing the proceeds of
this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide
funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or capital contributions.
Subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval
requirements, we may extend inter-company loans or make additional capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working
capital. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all. Pending remitting the
offering proceeds to the PRC, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations.

Although we may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our

utilized in calculating the net proceeds from this offering do not include $7.
million of previously paid transactions expenses. If the underwriters exercise 
their option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that the net 
proceeds will be approximately $229.3 million after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock by the selling

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to purchase 15,141,970 LLC
Interests directly from EVO LLC at a purchase price per LLC Interest equal to
the initial public offering price per share of Class A common stock less
underwriting discounts and commissions payable thereon.

EVO LLC anticipates that it will use the $197.8 million in net proceeds it
receives from the sale of LLC Interests to us to (i) repay $175.2 million of
second lien term loan borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in
full and (ii) with any remaining amounts, repay a portion of the deferred
purchase price under the Sterling acquisition. Our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities are comprised of a revolver, first lien term loan and second lien
term loan which are scheduled to mature on December 2021, December 2023 and
December 2024, respectively. As of March 31, 2018, our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities had an interest rate of 7.75% for revolver borrowings, 5.88% for
first lien term loan borrowings, and 10.88% for second lien term loan
borrowings. We entered into our Senior Secured Credit Facilities in December
2016 and used the proceeds to refinance our then-existing credit arrangements
with our lenders, repay a portion of the BMO Loan (as defined herein) and
partially finance our acquisition of Sterling.

The deferred purchase price under the Sterling acquisition accrues interest of
a rate of 5% per annum and is due in full on September 30, 2018.

invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit, or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately $244.2 million, 
based on an assumed initial offering price of $13.00 per share, which is the
midpoint of the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of
this prospectus, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses paid or payable by us.

If the underwriters’ exercise in full their over-allotment option to purchase
additional shares of Class A common stock, based on the same assumptions, we
estimate our net proceeds will be approximately $281.7 million after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
paid or payable by us.

Each $1.00 increase or decrease in the assumed initial public offering price
would increase or decrease, respectively, the net proceeds to us by 
approximately $19.3 million, assuming the number of shares offered by us, as set
forth on the cover page of this prospectus, remains the same and after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us. Similarly, each
increase or decrease of 1,000,000 in the number of shares of our Class A common
stock offered by us would increase or decrease the net proceeds that we receive
from this offering by approximately $12.1 million, assuming the assumed initial
public offering price remains the same and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace, and create a public
market for our Class A common stock.

We intend to use the proceeds from this offering, net of underwriting discounts
and commissions, to purchase newly-issued LLC Units from Pluralsight Holdings.
We intend to cause Pluralsight Holdings to (i) repay in full its outstanding 
indebtedness under its credit facility, which as of March 31, 2018, had an 
outstanding balance of $137.4 million, and the related prepayment premium of up
to 1.5%, which was $2.1 million as of March 31, 2018, plus any accrued interest,
(ii) pay the unpaid expenses of this offering, which we estimate will be $3.8 
million in the aggregate (which is in addition to the $2.3 million of offering
expenses that were paid by us as of March 31, 2018), and (iii) settle 
outstanding non-transferable equity appreciation rights, or EARs, issued by one
of our subsidiaries which will vest and be settled in cash upon the completion 
of this offering, which amount we estimate will be $0.2 million based on the 
number of EARs outstanding as of March 31, 2018 for which the service condition
had been satisfied and based on an assumed price of our Class A common stock at
the time of settlement being equal to $13.00 per share, which is the midpoint of
the estimated offering price range set forth on the cover page of this 
prospectus. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
satisfy income tax withholding obligations associated with the initial 
settlement of certain RSUs that will settle in November 2018. We intend to use 
the remainder of the net proceeds from the offering, if any, for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, including the acquisition of, or
investment in complementary products, technologies, solutions, or business, 
although we have no present commitments or agreements to enter into any 
acquisitions or investments.

Other than as discussed above, we do not have more specific plans for the net
proceeds from this offering. Accordingly, our management will have significant
flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will
be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of these
net proceeds. As of the date of this prospectus, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term interest-bearing investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or government securities. The goal with respect to the
investment of these net proceeds will be capital preservation and liquidity so
that these funds are readily available to fund our operations."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our founders of up to $200,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $700,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the 
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting discounts.

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account.

Nasdaq rules provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this offering
and the sale of the private units be deposited in a trust account. Of the gross
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units, a total of 
$202,000,000 (or $232,300,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is 
exercised in full), will be placed in a trust account in the United States in
New York, New York, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer and Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills,
notes and bonds with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and
which invest solely in U.S. Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may
be released to us to pay taxes, none of the funds held in the trust account will
be released from the trust account until the earlier of: (1) the completion of
our initial business combination within the required time period; (2) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed an
initial business combination in the required time period; and (3) our redemption
of our public shares in connection with the approval of any amendment to the
provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation our 
pre-initial business combination activity and related stockholders' rights,
including the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within the
required time period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial 
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using 
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust 
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our 
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general corporate
purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired
businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other
companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, but such members of our management
team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space and 
general and administrative services. Upon completion of our initial business 
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us 
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business 
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into additional units of the post-business
combination entity at a price of $10.00 per unit at the option of the lender.
The units would be identical to the private units. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

The forward purchase investor has entered into a contingent forward purchase 
greement with us as described below. Pursuant to the contingent forward 
purchase agreement, we may elect (subject to the forward purchase investor's
right to be excused from any specific business combination as described below)
to have the forward purchase investor purchase up to 2,500,000 shares of our
common stock, plus one of our redeemable warrants for each forward purchase
share, at a price of $10.00 per forward purchase share, for total gross proceeds
of up to $25,000,000. While we may elect to have the forward purchase investor
purchase no securities under the contingent forward purchase agreement, if we
request that the forward purchase investor purchase securities and the forward
purchase investor defaults on such purchase or the forward purchase investor
exercises its right of refusal as described herein, the forward purchase
investor will forfeit up to all of its ownership interest in our sponsor related
to founder shares, and our sponsor will have the right to redeem the forward
purchase investor's remaining ownership interest in our sponsor at the original
purchase price. Any funds from the sale of the forward purchase securities may
be used as part of the consideration to the sellers in the initial business
combination, for expenses in connection with the initial business combination or
for the combined company's working capital needs. This commitment is independent
of the percentage of stockholders electing to redeem their public shares and
could provide us with a minimum funding level for the initial business
combination.

Our anchor investor has expressed to us an interest to purchase $25 million of
public units in this offering and we have agreed to direct the underwriters to
sell to our anchor investor such number of public units. Further, the anchor 
investor has agreed with us that, if it does not own the number of public shares 
equal to 2,500,000 public shares (which amount will be reduced on a pro rata
basis if less than 20,000,000 units are sold in this offering), at the time of
any stockholder vote with respect to an initial business combination or the
business day immediately prior to the consummation of our initial business
combination, it will forfeit all or a portion of the 468,277 founder shares it
purchased prior to this offering on a pro rata basis. In such a case, our
sponsor (or its designee), will have the right (but not the obligation) to
repurchase all or a portion of the private placement units held by our anchor
investor at their original purchase price. There can be no assurance that the
anchor investor will acquire any public units in this offering or what amount of
equity the anchor investor will retain, if any, upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. In the event that such anchor investor purchases
such units (either in this offering or after) and votes them in favor of our
initial business combination, it is possible that no votes from other public
stockholders would be required to approve our initial business combination,
depending on the number of shares that are present at the meeting to approve
such transaction. As a result of the founder shares and private placement units
that our anchor investor may hold, it may have different interests with respect
to a vote on an initial business combination than other public stockholders.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our 
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be 
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of common stock that
such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations 
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of
this offering, or, if our charter documents are amended to so provide, (iii) the
redemption of our public shares in connection with a stockholder vote to amended
and restated certificate of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing 
of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our 
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering 
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders' rights or
pre-business combination activity, subject to applicable law. In no other 
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our founders, directors, director nominees and executive officers have entered 
into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive
their redemption rights with respect to any common stock held by them in 
connection with the completion of our initial business combination or any
amendment to the provisions of our amended and restated certificate of 
incorporation relating to our pre-initial business combination activity and 
related stockholders' rights and (2) waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and
private shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within
24 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our founders, executive
officers, directors, or director nominees acquire public shares after this
offering they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the 24-month time frame."

    if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of 
    May 10, 2018, we have borrowed $213,000 (of up to $300,000 available to us)
    under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the 
    expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon completion of 
    this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting
    commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than as set forth
    in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the $1,000,000 of 
    offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside for 
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering expenses
    are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
    post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 4.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $13,500,000, which constitutes the underwriter’s 
    deferred commissions (or $15,525,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment 
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds 
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred 
    underwriting discounts and commissions. 

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify an initial business combination target
    in a specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur 
    additional expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement
    of special legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a
    result, we may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and 
    financial due diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use
    of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of 
    allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current
    estimates for any specific category of expenses, would not be available for
    our expenses.   
   
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our 
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.                                                         

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $306,000,000 (or $351,900,000 if the underwriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $13,500,000 (or $15,525,000 if the
underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account in the United States
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3.6 million per year,
assuming an interest rate of 1.20% per year; however, we can provide no
assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 18 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18 months from
the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation
of this offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we could seek
such additional capital through loans or additional investments from our
sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates, but such persons
are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of May
10, 2018, we have borrowed $213,000 under the promissory note with our sponsor
to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2018 or
the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, initial stockholders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may purchase shares or public
warrants in privately negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and NASDAQ rules. However, they have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material nonpublic information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules. Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16
of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such reporting
requirements. None of the funds held in the trust account will be used to
purchase shares or public warrants in such transactions prior to completion of
our initial business combination. 

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the initial business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining stockholder approval of the initial business combination or to satisfy
a closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our initial
business combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not
be met. The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce
the number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any
matters submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our
initial business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in
the completion of our initial business combination that may not otherwise have
been possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of
our shares of Class A common stock or warrants may be reduced and the number of
beneficial holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult
to maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriter’s fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the initial business combination,
and instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 18 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 18 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable
law and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not
limited to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."

approximately US$163.9 million, or approximately US$189.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to enhance our brand recognition,
create a public market for our shares for the benefit of all shareholders,
retain talented employees by providing them with equity incentives, and obtain
additional capital. We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately 30% to 40% for investment in our content ecosystem and eSports 
  partners to continue expanding our content genres and improving our content 
  quality;                                                      

• approximately 30% to 40% for research and development, to continue to invest 
  in and strengthen our technologies;                                

• approximately 10% to 15% for expanding and enhancing our product and service 
  offerings, including marketing and promotional activities to acquire users and
  strengthen our brand; and                               

• the balance for general corporate purposes, which may include working capital
  needs and potential strategic acquisitions, investments and alliances.

Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products, services or technologies, we do not have agreements or commitments for
any material acquisitions as of the date of this prospectus. The amounts and
timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash generated
by our operations, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. 

In using the proceeds of this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws and
regulations as an offshore holding company to provide funding to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through loans or capital contributions
and to our variable interest entity only through loans, subject to the approval
of government authorities and limit on the amount of capital contributions and
loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable government registration and
approval requirements, we may extend inter-company loans to our wholly
foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make additional capital contributions to
our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund its capital expenditures or working
capital. For an increase of registered capital of our wholly foreign-owned
subsidiary, we need to submit recordation of modification documents with the MOC
or its local counterparts within 30 days of such increase of registered capital.
If we provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary through loans, the
total amount of such loans may not exceed the difference between the entity’s
total investment as approved by the foreign investment authorities and its
registered capital. Such loans must be registered with SAFE or its local 
branches, which usually takes up to 20 working days to complete. We cannot
assure you that we will be able to obtain these government registrations or
approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $75.9 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option to purchase additional shares
from us is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
$87.7 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with approximately $114.3 million of cash and cash equivalents as of
March 31, 2018, as follows:

• approximately $45.0 million to $50.0 million to fund proof of concept clinical
  trials in our inflammatory diseases programs;                    

• approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million to fund proof of concept clinical
  trials in our oncology programs;                                 

• approximately $35.0 million to $45.0 million to invest in our platform and to
  advance additional preclinical development activities; and             

• the remainder to fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general
  corporate purposes.                                               

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting the
cost necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and we anticipate
that we will need additional funds to complete the development of any product
candidates we identify. The amounts and timing of our actual use of proceeds may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors. 

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in additional businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently
we have no specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our cash and
cash equivalents as of March 31, 2018, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements into the second half of 2020, by which time we expect to have
received safety, tolerability, biomarker and clinical response data from our
ongoing and planned clinical trials for EDP1066, EDP1815 and EDP1503. We have
based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could
use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Until such time, if ever, as we can generate substantial product revenues, we
expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings, collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements. With
the exception of our existing debt arrangement, we do not have any committed
external source of funds. To the extent that we raise additional capital through
the sale of equity or convertible debt securities, the ownership interests of
our existing stockholders may be diluted, and the terms of these securities may
include liquidation or other preferences that could adversely affect the rights
of our common stockholders. Additional debt financing, if available, may involve
agreements that include restrictive covenants that limit our ability to take
specific actions, such as incurring additional debt, making capital expenditures
or declaring dividends, that could adversely impact our ability to conduct our
business.

If we raise funds through collaborations, strategic alliances or licensing
arrangements with third parties, we may have to relinquish valuable rights to
our technologies, future revenue streams, research programs or product
candidates or to grant licenses on terms that may not be favorable to us. If we
are unable to raise additional funds through equity or debt financings when
needed, we may be required to delay, limit or terminate our product development
or future commercialization efforts or grant rights to develop and market
product candidates that we would otherwise prefer to develop and market
ourselves.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities, certificates of
deposit or U.S. government securities."

other banks or financial institutions or other complementary businesses to the
extent such opportunities arise, and the maintenance of our capital and

estimated offering expenses payable to us.

We intend to initially retain the net proceeds from this offering at our holding
company and to use such proceeds as needed to support our continued growth,
including organic growth and potential future acquisitions, and for general
corporate purposes. We may use a portion of net proceeds from this offering to
repay outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit described below, plus
accrued and unpaid interest, which was $7.8 million as of December 31, 2017. At
any given time, we may be evaluating and conducting due diligence with respect
to potential acquisition candidates. We cannot assure you that we will enter
into any definitive agreements in respect of any such potential transactions.
Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering. Although we intend to initially retain the net proceeds of this
offering at our holding company, we may elect to contribute a portion of the net
proceeds to the Bank as regulatory capital. The precise amounts and timing of
our use of the proceeds will depend upon market conditions and other factors and
will be in the discretion of our management.

We entered into our line of credit with a third party lender in May 2017. It
allows for borrowing of up to $20 million. The interest rate on this line of
credit is based upon 90-day LIBOR plus 4.00% per annum, and unpaid principal and
interest is due at the stated maturity on May 12, 2022. This line of credit is
secured by a pledge of all of the common stock of the Bank. This line of credit
may be prepaid at any time without penalty, so long as such prepayment includes
the payment of all interest accrued through the date of the repayments, and, in
the case of prepayment of the entire loan, the amount of attorneys’ fees and
disbursements of the lender. We are subject to various financial covenants under
this line of credit, and as of December 31, 2017 we were in compliance with all
covenants. As of December 31, 2017, total borrowing capacity of $12.2 million
was available under this line of credit and $7.8 million was drawn, with an
average interest rate of 5.24%."

invest in the clinical development of our product candidates, including 
investing in the following planned and ongoing clinical trials as follows:

• approximately $15 million to fund the global pivotal clinical trial for 
  varlitinib in biliary tract cancer;                                       

• approximately $5 million to fund the China pivotal clinical trial for 
  varlitinib in biliary tract cancer;                                       

• approximately $3.5 million to fund the global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for
  varlitinib in gastric cancer;

  clinical trials.                                                          

In connection with these trials, a portion of the net proceeds will also be used
for manufacturing activities in preparation for a potential commercial launch.
The remaining net proceeds, if any, are expected to fund new and other ongoing
research and development activities, working capital and other general corporate
purposes. Although we anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering will
be sufficient to allow us to complete the global pivotal trial for varlitinib in
biliary tract cancer, the China pivotal trial for varlitinib in biliary tract
cancer, the global clinical trials for ASLAN003 in AML and the ASLAN004 
preclinical and Phase 1 clinical trials, we currently do not expect the net
proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to cover all of the expenses of
the Phase 3 part of our global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for varlitinib in 
gastric cancer, which we expect will require approximately $50 million in 
additional funding. Furthermore, we will require additional capital beyond this
offering in order to complete pivotal clinical trials of (except with respect to
varlitinib in biliary tract cancer), file for regulatory approval for, or
commercialize any of our product candidates. While we anticipate seeking
additional capital in the future through further equity offerings and/or debt
borrowings, or through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing
arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and prevailing business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and prevailing business conditions
evolve. Predicting the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be
difficult and the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending the application of the net proceeds as described above, we plan to
invest them in short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments or certificates of deposit."

be sufficient to allow us to complete the global pivotal trial for varlitinib in
biliary tract cancer, the China pivotal trial for varlitinib in biliary tract
cancer, the global clinical trials for ASLAN003 in AML and the ASLAN004 
preclinical and Phase 1 clinical trials, we currently do not expect the net
proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to cover all of the expenses of
the Phase 3 part of our global Phase 2/3 clinical trial for varlitinib in 
gastric cancer, which we expect will require approximately $50 million in 
additional funding. Furthermore, we will require additional capital beyond this
offering in order to complete pivotal clinical trials of (except with respect to
varlitinib in biliary tract cancer), file for regulatory approval for, or
commercialize any of our product candidates. While we anticipate seeking
additional capital in the future through further equity offerings and/or debt
borrowings, or through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing
arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements, we cannot guarantee
that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and prevailing business conditions,
which could change in the future as our plans and prevailing business conditions
evolve. Predicting the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be
difficult and the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our product candidates and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending the application of the net proceeds as described above, we plan to
invest them in short-term, interest bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments or certificates of deposit."

estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. The foregoing description of estimated net proceeds does
not give effect to the proceeds, if any, from the potential exercise of the
warrants offered hereby. This assumes an initial public offering price of $9.00
per unit, which is the midpoint of the estimated offering price range on the
cover page of this prospectus.

As of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $9.2 million. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and
cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $8.5 million to fund research and development expenses of our 
  oral PTH candidate, EB612 required to conduct and complete the preparatory 
  work for our planned Phase 2b/3 trial related to hypoparathyroidism;
 
• approximately $7.0 million to fund research and development expenses of our 
  oral PTH candidate, EB613 required to conduct our planned Phase 2a study 
  related to osteoporosis; and
 
• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to obtain additional financing, the relative
success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs,
including a change in our planned course of development or the termination of a
clinical program necessitated by the results of data received from clinical
trials, the amount and timing of revenues, if any, received from future
collaborations. As a result, management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we
might decide to postpone or not pursue other clinical trials or preclinical
activities if the net proceeds from this offering and our other sources of cash
are less than expected.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for at least 12 months. Following the completion of this offering,
we will need additional capital for the Phase 2b/3 trial of our oral PTH
candidate EB612 (following the preparatory work funded from the proceeds of this
offering) and for other trials, marketing and sales development for EB612, if
approved. We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be
incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we
currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing financial assets and certificates
of deposit.

A $1.00 increase (decrease) in the assumed initial public offering price of 
$9.00 per unit, the midpoint of the range set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus, would increase (decrease) our net proceeds from this offering by
approximately $1.2 million (or $1.4 million if the underwriters fully exercise
their over-allotment option), assuming the number of units offered by us remains
the same.

We may also increase or decrease the number of units we are offering. An
increase (decrease) of 200,000 units offered by us would increase (decrease) our
net proceeds from this offering by $1.66 million, assuming the public offering
price per unit remains the same. The information on net proceeds payable to us
discussed above is illustrative only and will adjust based on the actual initial
public offering price, the actual number of units offered by us, and other terms
of the offering determined at pricing."

sooner that we currently expect.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds

our management regarding the application of our net proceeds. The timing and
amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash
flows from operations, the anticipated growth of our business, and the

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
    from the funds we received from our initial shareholders described below. 
    These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to
    us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private warrants.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Certain of our initial shareholders have committed that they or their designees
will purchase the private warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of
$2,250,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. They have also agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they or their 
designees will purchase from us an additional number of private warrants (up to
a maximum of 187,500 private warrants, for a total of 2,437,500 private 
warrants, or a total purchase price of $2,437,500, if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant necessary to 
maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this 
offering. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private 
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are 
identical to the warrants underlying the units sold in this offering subject to
certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account 
described below.

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment to Metropolitan Capital Partners II, LP, an affiliate of Jeffrey
Schwarz, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services,
including office space, utilities and bookkeeping services. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Metropolitan Capital Partners II, LP for our benefit and is
not intended to provide Mr. Schwarz with compensation in lieu of a salary. We
believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by
Metropolitan Capital Partners II, LP is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee and the
repayment of $200,000 of non-interest bearing loans and advances from
Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC (none of which payments will be made from
the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion
of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid
to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, they will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our initial shareholders,
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested
director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the
amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the
extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an
initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations, due diligence of
prospective target businesses, legal and accounting fees related to SEC
reporting obligations, the monthly administrative fee described above, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is 
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise 
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such 
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to
4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable
finders’ fees which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial
business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust 
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be 
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds 
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways 
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new 
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, MCP V —
Bushwick LLC has agreed to pay the costs of liquidation to the extent the funds
available to us outside of the trust account are insufficient and has agreed not
to seek repayment of such amounts.

As of the date of this prospectus, Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC, one of
our initial shareholders and an affiliate of Jeffrey E. Schwarz, our Chief
Executive Officer, has loaned and advanced us an aggregate of $200,000 which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, Nasdaq listing fees and
a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan and advances will
be payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan and
advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem
reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial
business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to
$1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per
unit. The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. In the event that
the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but
no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in connection with our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period, (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares, or sells such
shares to us in a tender offer, in connection with a business combination which
we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect our public
shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a
business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. This
redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, whether
proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or
director nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
    from the funds we received from our initial shareholders described below. 
    These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to
    us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private warrants.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $500,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Certain of our initial shareholders have committed that they or their designees
will purchase the private warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of
$2,250,000) from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the
consummation of this offering. They have also agreed that if the over-allotment
option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they or their 
designees will purchase from us an additional number of private warrants (up to
a maximum of 187,500 private warrants, for a total of 2,437,500 private 
warrants, or a total purchase price of $2,437,500, if the over-allotment option
is exercised in full) at a price of $1.00 per private warrant necessary to 
maintain in the trust account $10.00 per unit sold to the public in this 
offering. These additional private warrants will be purchased in a private 
placement that will occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting
from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The private warrants are 
identical to the warrants underlying the units sold in this offering subject to
certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account 
described below.

$50,000,000, or $57,500,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private warrants, will be
placed in a U.S.-based trust account maintained by Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
income or other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment to Metropolitan Capital Partners II, LP, an affiliate of Jeffrey
Schwarz, of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and administrative services,
including office space, utilities and bookkeeping services. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Metropolitan Capital Partners II, LP for our benefit and is
not intended to provide Mr. Schwarz with compensation in lieu of a salary. We
believe, based on rents and fees for similar services, that the fee charged by
Metropolitan Capital Partners II, LP is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee and the
repayment of $200,000 of non-interest bearing loans and advances from
Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC (none of which payments will be made from
the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion
of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid
to our initial shareholders, officers, directors or any of their respective
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of
transaction that it is). However, they will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Our audit committee will review
and approve all reimbursements and payments made to our initial shareholders,
officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with any interested
director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no limit on the
amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that to the
extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an
initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We intend to use the proceeds for legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations, due diligence of
prospective target businesses, legal and accounting fees related to SEC
reporting obligations, the monthly administrative fee described above, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is 
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise 
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently 
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such 
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to
4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable
finders’ fees which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial
business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust 
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be 
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds 
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways 
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new 
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, MCP V —
Bushwick LLC has agreed to pay the costs of liquidation to the extent the funds
available to us outside of the trust account are insufficient and has agreed not
to seek repayment of such amounts.

As of the date of this prospectus, Metropolitan Capital Partners V, LLC, one of
our initial shareholders and an affiliate of Jeffrey E. Schwarz, our Chief
Executive Officer, has loaned and advanced us an aggregate of $200,000 which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, Nasdaq listing fees and
a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan and advances will
be payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan and
advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for
payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our officers, directors and their affiliates may, but are not obligated to, loan
us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem
reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a
promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial
business combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to
$1,500,000 of the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per
unit. The warrants would be identical to the private warrants. In the event that
the initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts, but
no proceeds from our trust account would be used for such repayment.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares in connection with our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period, (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares, or sells such
shares to us in a tender offer, in connection with a business combination which
we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated memorandum and articles of association that would affect our public
shareholders’ ability to convert or sell their shares to us in connection with a
business combination as described herein or affect the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete a
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering. This
redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment
to our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association, whether
proposed by our initial shareholders, any executive officer, director or
director nominee, or any other person. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $101.2 million at the
initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the
net proceeds to us will be approximately $116.9 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $23.0 to $25.0 million to further the clinical development of
  5F9 through completion of our existing Phase 1 monotherapy and planned PD-L1
  combination clinical trials;

• approximately $37.0 to $40.0 million to further the clinical development of
  5F9 through completion of Phase 2 combination clinical trials in NHL and CRC
  or alternative Phase 2 indications if there are compelling clinical data;

• approximately $4.0 to $5.0 million to further the development of our
  anti-SIRPa antibody product candidate, FSI-189, through IND enabling studies;

• up to $6.0 million in upfront fees to license intellectual property, although
  we have no present commitments or agreements to license intellectual property;
  and 

• the remaining proceeds for research and drug discovery activities related to
  additional product candidates, working capital and general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development process,
it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds
from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. Our management will
have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and
the amount of cash obtained through future collaborations, if any. Following
this offering, we will require additional funding in order to complete clinical
development and commercialize our lead product candidate, 5F9, and complete the
clinical development of any additional product candidates.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering as described above, we intend
to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade securities or
government securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that have been allocated for the
    payment of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the
    event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such
    amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.
 
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of 3.5% of
    the gross proceeds of this offering, excluding the gross proceeds received
    from the 9 million units purchased by Mr. Leung, Mr. Wu and certain other
    investors identified by them, which units are not subject to any
    underwriting discounts or commissions.. Upon and concurrently with the
    completion of our initial business combination, $5,600,000, which
    constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or $6,912,500 if the
    underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to
    the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account. The remaining
    funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming shareholders,
    will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business
    combination. In the event we identify a business combination target in a
    specific industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional
    expenses associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special
    legal counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we
    may engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The expenses described in the table above do not include
    $50,000 per year we may pay to each of our independent directors at their
    option.
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.
 
Of the $257.0 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or $295.3 million
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, $250.0 million
($10.00 per unit), or $287.5 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will be deposited into a trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and
$7.0 million, or up to $7.75 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full, will be used to pay expenses in connection with the
closing of this offering and for working capital following this offering. The
proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government
treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company
Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Prior to
such time, such proceeds will not be invested and will be held in a non-interest
bearing trust account. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
following the investment of such funds will be approximately $3,750,000 per
year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year; however, we can provide no
assurances regarding this amount. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of
the principal or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal
of interest to pay our income taxes, if any, until the earliest of  (i) the
completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law,
or (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly submitted in connection
with a shareholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering.
Based on current interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust
account will be sufficient to pay income taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective initial
business combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required
to seek additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans
or additional investments from our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor, but
such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the NYSE, we will
pay $10,000 per month to an affiliate of our sponsor for office space,
secretarial and administrative services provided to members of our management
team. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we
will cease paying these monthly fees.

We will also pay each of our independent directors for services rendered as
board members prior to the completion of our initial business combination, at
their option, up to $50,000 per year commencing on the date of this prospectus
or 10,000 founder shares (to be transferred to such director by the sponsor),
and will reimburse such directors for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred
in connection with fulfilling their roles as directors.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor may, but is not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we
complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts
out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans
would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event
that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of
the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned
amounts. Up to $2,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of the
post business combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option
of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants. Except as set forth above, the terms of such loans, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

Prior to this offering, we entered into forward purchase agreements pursuant to
which the anchor investors agreed to purchase an aggregate of 18,100,000 Class A
ordinary shares plus 4,525,000 redeemable warrants for a purchase price of
$10.00 multiplied by the number of Class A ordinary shares, or $181,000,000 in
the aggregate, which aggregate purchase price includes purchases by entities
controlled by Antony Leung and Carl Wu, our Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer, for an aggregate of  $21,000,000, in a private placement to close
concurrently with our initial business combination. In connection with these
agreements, our sponsor transferred to the anchor investors an aggregate of
2,262,500 founder shares as an inducement to enter into the forward purchase
agreements for no cash consideration. The founder shares transferred to the
anchor investors are subject to similar contractual conditions and restrictions
as the founder shares issued to our sponsor. The anchor investors will have
redemption rights with respect to any public shares they own. The forward
purchase warrants will have the same terms as our public warrants.

The forward purchase agreements also provide that the anchor investors are
entitled to registration rights with respect to (A) the forward purchase
securities and Class A ordinary shares underlying the forward purchase warrants
and founder shares, and (B) any other Class A ordinary shares or warrants
acquired by the anchor investors, including any time after we complete our
initial business combination.

The proceeds from the sale of the forward purchase shares may be used as part of
the consideration to the sellers in the initial business combination, expenses
in connection with our initial business combination or for working capital in
the post-transaction company. These purchases will be required to be made
regardless of whether any Class A ordinary shares are redeemed by our public
shareholders and are intended to provide us with minimum funding level for our
initial business combination. Our sponsor and executive officers have agreed,
pursuant to a written letter agreement, not to participate in the formation of,
or become an officer or director of, any other blank check company until we have
entered into a definitive agreement regarding our initial business combination
or we have failed to complete our initial business combination within 24 months
after the closing of this offering."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $84.0 million (or
$97.0 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $20.4 million. We
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to fund the further commercialization and 
  marketing of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System, primarily through
  expansion of sales, customer support and practice development teams;     

• approximately $17.0 million to fund research and development activities,
  which may include hardware and software product development and         
  enhancements of our NeuroStar Advanced Therapy System and clinical      
  development expenses relating to additional indications, which may      
  include bipolar depression, post-traumatic stress disorder and potential
  other clinical indications yet to be determined; and                     

• the balance for general corporate purposes, including general and
  administrative expenses and working capital.                            

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with complete certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in-license of complementary businesses,
technologies or intellectual property. While we have no current agreements for
any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of
the net proceeds for these purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our sales and marketing expansion efforts, the
progress of our clinical trials and other development efforts for our NeuroStar
Advanced Therapy System and the amount of cash used in our operations. We
therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds to be used
for the purposes described above. For example, at this stage of development, it
is not possible to predict the total costs associated with completing the
clinical development and approval process of the NeuroStar Advanced Therapy
System or a similar product for the treatment of post-traumatic stress disorder,
bipolar depression or any other indication. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term,
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $109.0 million, or
approximately $125.9 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based on the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

As of March 31, 2018, we had cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments
of $36.8 million. We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from
this offering, together with such existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, as follows: 

• approximately $30 million to fund the development of MRT5005 for the treatment
  of patients with cystic fibrosis;                                 

• approximately $13 million to fund the development of MRT5201 for the treatment
  of patients with ornithine transcarbamylase deficiency; 
          
• approximately $25 million to fund discovery and additional preclinical 
  research and development of additional product candidates and platform
  enhancement; and 
                                                           
• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes. 

We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for the acquisition
of businesses, technologies or other assets that we believe are complementary to
our own, although we currently have no agreements, commitments or understandings
with respect to any such transaction. 

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments represents our intentions based upon our
current plans and business conditions, which could change in the future as our
plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development, the status of and results from clinical trials, the
timing of regulatory submissions and the outcome of regulatory review, as well
as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering. 

We believe that the anticipated net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments (which excludes
the $45.0 million we have the right to receive as an upfront payment if the
collaboration and license agreement with Sanofi becomes effective), will enable
us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through
February 2020. We do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be sufficient to
enable us to complete our Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MRT5005 or our planned
Phase 1/2 clinical trial of MRT5201. We will require additional capital to
advance MRT5005 and MRT5201 through necessary clinical trials and complete the
clinical development of MRT5005 and MRT5201, commercialize either product
candidate, if we receive regulatory approval, and pursue in-licenses or
acquisitions of other product candidates, if any. Due to the numerous risks and
uncertainties associated with product development, including the risks and
uncertainties with respect to successful enrollment and completion of clinical
trials, at this time, we cannot reasonably estimate the amount of additional
funding that will be necessary to complete the clinical development of MRT5005,
MRT5201 or any future product candidates. If we receive regulatory approval for
MRT5005, MRT5201 or other product candidates, we will incur significant
commercialization expenses related to product manufacturing, sales, marketing
and distribution. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

shares of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $201.7 
million, at the initial public offering price of $19.00 per share, and after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $232.7 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:

• approximately $13 million for supporting our activities for our NDA submission
  and approval process for TRC101;                               

• approximately $39 million for manufacturing activities related to TRC101;

• approximately $58 million for conducting our safety extension trial, 
  TRCA-301E, and commencing our confirmatory postmarketing trial, known as the
  VALOR-CKD trial, or TRCA-303;                                         

• approximately $17 million for commercial expenses related to TRC101;

• approximately $10 million for interest payments under our Loan and Security
  Agreement, or the Term Loan, with Hercules Capital, Inc., or Hercules; and

• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes.

On February 28, 2018, we entered into the Term Loan with Hercules. The Term Loan
bears interest at a floating per annum interest rate equal to the greater of
either (i) 8.35% or (ii) the lesser of (x) 8.35% plus the prime rate as reported
in The Wall Street Journal minus 5.00% and (y) 9.85%. The Term Loan repayment
schedule provides for interest only payments for the first 16 months, followed
by consecutive equal monthly payments of principal and interest commencing on
July 1, 2019 and continuing through the maturity date of March 1, 2022; however,
if we obtain final approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the
New Drug Application for TRC101 on or before February 15, 2022, the maturity
date will be September 1, 2022. The Term Loan also provides for a payment equal
to 6.55% multiplied by the greater of (i) the aggregate term loans funded and
(ii)(a) the aggregate term loans funded plus the greater of (i) the aggregate
term loans funded and (ii)(a) the aggregate term loans funded plus (b) one half
of (x) $60.0 million minus (y) the aggregate term loans funded, which is due
when the Term Loan becomes due or upon prepayment of the facility. If we elect
to prepay the Term Loan, there is also a prepayment fee of between 1% and 2% of
the principal amount being prepaid depending on the timing and circumstances of
prepayment. Proceeds from the Term Loan are being used for general corporate
purposes.

Our expected use of proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based on our present plans and business condition. As of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for
the proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the actual
amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above. We may also use a
portion of the proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets. Although we have no specific
agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any in-licensing
activity or acquisition, we evaluate these opportunities and engage in related
discussions with other companies from time to time.

The net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities and the available amount under our Term Loan with
Hercules may not be sufficient for us to fund TRC101 through regulatory
approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to complete our
confirmatory postmarketing trial, VALOR-CKD, and commercialization of TRC101.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing and outcome of any ongoing or future clinical studies, and the timing and
outcome of regulatory submissions. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion over the use of the proceeds from this offering.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we may invest the proceeds
in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of deposit or

approximately US$205.1 million, or approximately US$236.5 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us, as well as net proceeds of approximately US$173.1 million from
the concurrent private placement, after deducting the placement fee payable by
us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement of
convertible notes as follows:

• approximately US$70 million for improving our transaction service 
  capabilities;

• approximately US$70 million for research and development; and

• the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding potential
  strategic investments and acquisitions, although we have not identified any
  specific investments or acquisition opportunities at this time.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans
and business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering
and the concurrent private placement of convertible notes. Our management,
however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply the net
proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement of convertible
notes. If an unforeseen event occurs or business conditions change, we may use
the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement of
convertible notes differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement of 
convertible notes, we are permitted under PRC laws and regulations as an
offshore holding company to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through
loans or capital contributions and to our VIEs only through loans, subject to
satisfaction of applicable government registration and approval requirements.
There is currently no statutory limit to the amount of funding that we can
provide to our PRC subsidiaries through capital contribution, and we can provide
funding to our PRC subsidiaries and our VIEs and the subsidiaries of the VIEs
through loans as long as the loan amount does not exceed the statutory limit,
which is twice the amount of the relevant entities' respective net assets
calculated in accordance with China accounting standards. Further, as we expect
to use the proceeds of this offering in China in the form of Renminbi, our PRC
subsidiaries and VIEs and the subsidiaries of our VIEs will need to convert the
capital contributions or loans they receive from U.S. dollars to Renminbi before
using such capital contribution or loans. However, we cannot assure you that we 
will be able to meet the aforementioned registration and approval requirements."

approximately $103.6 million if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, based on the initial public offering price
of $16.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purpose of this offering is to increase our financial flexibility 
and create a public market for our common stock.

We currently expect to use our existing cash, cash equivalents and marketable 
securities, together with the net proceeds from this offering, as follows:

• approximately $40.0 million to fund the ongoing clinical development of
  NEO-PV-01, including costs associated with all patients reaching the 52-week
  timepoint in our NT-001 and NT-002 clinical trials, and a portion of the costs
  associated with additional planned clinical trials, including NT-003 and
  NT-004;

• approximately $40.0 million to fund our pre-clinical programs and research
  activities, including costs related to our planned clinical development of
  NEO-PTC-01, including the initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial, the
  initiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial for NEO-SV-01, as well as the continued
  other pre-clinical research across our multiple treatment modalities; and

• the remainder of the proceeds are expected to fund capital expenditures,
  working capital and other general corporate purposes.  

Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities, together with the net proceeds from this offering,
will be sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements into at least the first quarter of 2020.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the net
proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering. Due to
uncertainties inherent in the product development process, it is difficult to
estimate the exact amounts of the net proceeds that will be used for any
particular purpose. We may use our existing cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities and the future payments, if any, generated from any future
collaboration agreements to fund our operations, either of which may alter the
amount of net proceeds used for a particular purpose. In addition, the amount,
allocation and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the results of our research and development efforts, the
timing and success of clinical trials and the timing of regulatory submissions.
Following this offering, we will require substantial capital to complete
clinical development, seek regulatory approval of and, if approved,
commercialize NEO-PV-01, NEO-PTC-01 and NEO-SV-01. We may seek additional funds
through public or private equity, debt financings or other sources, including
strategic collaborations. We will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.
Pending their uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

approximately $68.6 million (or $79.5 million if the underwriters exercise their
option to purchase additional shares of common stock in full), after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets. We currently estimate
that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

(i) approximately $35.0 million to fund our activities related to 
    commercialization of our gammaCore products, including the full market 
    launch of such products in the United States, initially for the acute 
    treatment of migraine and episodic cluster headache. For example, we intend
    to hire additional territory business managers which will expand our 
    coverage of high-prescribers of headache medications. We also expect to use
    a portion of these funds to create and develop patient and professional 
    promotional tactics across multiple channels including social, digital, and
    print media;

(ii) approximately $10.0 million to fund expansion of our clinical program into
     additional indications in headache and rheumatology. For example, in 2018,
     we expect to initiate trials to support potential label expansion in 
     headache, including pivotal trials in migraine prevention and migraine in 
     adolescents, and pilot trials in post-traumatic headache. In 2018, we also
     expect to initiate a pivotal trial in Sjögren’s syndrome, our first 
     rheumatology indication, and over the next 24 months, we expect to initiate
     a pivotal trial in rheumatoid arthritis. We also expect to deploy proceeds
     from this offering to conduct premarket activities in rheumatology 
     consisting of market analysis, physician and patient segmentation research,
     and promotional/campaign development;

(iii) approximately $3.0 million to fund the build out of our specialty 
      distribution channel for the anticipated launch of gammaCore Sapphire, the
      successor to gammaCore, in the third quarter of 2018. For example, our 
      specialty distribution platform will require specialized scanning hardware
      at every specialty pharmacy site, a data warehouse with custom software,
      training of specialty pharmacists, and support within the network for 
      handling patient volume; and

(iv) the remaining balance for working capital, including inventory, and other
     corporate purposes.

In addition, we may also use a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to
acquire and invest in complementary products, technologies, services or
businesses; however, we currently have no plans, agreements or commitments to
complete any such transaction nor are we involved in negotiations to do so.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our plans and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors.
As a result, management will have broad discretion in its application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment in such application.

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest in short- and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government.

Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity requirements, we believe
that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and
cash equivalents, will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the
next 12 months, and that thereafter we may need additional funding to finance
our commercialization, clinical development and specialty distribution
activities."

approximately $133.9 million, or $154.8 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, based on the initial public
offering price of $17.00 per ADS and after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of March 31, 2018, we had cash of $120.7 million. We currently expect to use
the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash, to advance
our clinical pipeline, including, specifically:

• approximately $85.0 million to complete the proof-of-concept phases of our
  Phase 1/2 clinical trials of AUTO2 in multiple myeloma, AUTO3 in pediatric ALL
  and DLBCL, and AUTO4 in peripheral T-cell lymphoma, support the clinical trial
  conducted by UCL for AUTO1 in adult ALL through proof-of-concept, and advance
  three of these product candidates through later phases of clinical development
  and, potentially, registration;

• approximately $14.0 million to conduct non-clinical development to IND filing
  of AUTO2 NG, AUTO3 NG and AUTO5, our earlier stage hematological programs, and
  AUTO6 NG and AUTO7, our product candidates targeting solid tumor indications;

• approximately $17.0 million to fund our research and development activities to
  further expand our T cell programming technologies and develop future product
  candidates and follow-on versions of our more advanced product candidates;

• approximately $50.0 million to fund our manufacturing activities to support
  our ongoing and future clinical trials and potential commercial launch; and

• the balance for other general corporate purposes, including general and 
  administrative expenses, development of our commercial infrastructure and
  working capital.                                                          

Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that the net
proceeds from this offering, combined with our current cash, will be sufficient
to fund operations through December 2020, but that we will need to raise
additional capital in order to develop and commercialize our product candidates,
including any potential future trials that may be required by regulatory
authorities. Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our
current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of
the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the actual amounts that we will spend on the uses set forth above.
We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through the acquisition or in-license of complementary product
candidates or programming technologies. While we have no current agreements for
any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of
the net proceeds for these purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials, the potential for
achieving accelerated regulatory approval and the amount of cash used in our
operations. We therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net
proceeds to be used for the purposes described above. We may find it necessary
or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds.

Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest
bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to
the investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so
that such funds are readily available to fund our operations."

this offering will be approximately $92.2 million, or $106.5 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
received by us in this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $15.0 million to fund our ongoing Phase 2 clinical study of
  NYX-2925 for the treatment of painful DPN and our ongoing Phase 2 exploratory
  clinical study of NYX-2925 in subjects with fibromyalgia through completion;

• approximately $13.0 million to advance NYX-783 for the treatment of PTSD
  through completion of Phase 1 clinical development and through completion
  of our planned Phase 2 clinical study;

• approximately $30.0 million to advance NYX-458 for the treatment of
  Parkinson's disease cognitive impairment through completion of our planned
  Phase 1 clinical development and into our planned Phase 2 clinical study; and

• the remainder, if any, to fund clinical studies designed to explore
  NMDAr-dependent biomarkers, to further develop any additional product
  candidates that we select, and for working capital and other general corporate
  purposes, which will include expanding our internal research and development
  capabilities, hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and the
  costs of operating as a public company.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, together
with the net proceeds to us from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through the first half of 2020. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. We will need to raise substantial
additional funds to complete registration trials for NYX-2925 and NYX-783, and
before we can expect to commercialize any products, if approved. We will also
require additional funds to complete development of NYX-458 for the treatment of
Parkinson's disease cognitive impairment, including for the completion of our
planned Phase 2 clinical study, the amounts of which will depend on the ultimate
clinical development paths we pursue. We may satisfy our future cash needs
through public or private equity or debt financings, government or other
third-party funding, marketing and distribution arrangements and other
collaborations, strategic alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination
of these approaches.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies or
clinical studies we may commence in the future, as well as our existing
collaboration with Allergan and any other collaborations that we may enter into
with third parties for NYX-2925, NYX-783, NYX-458, or any future product
candidates or business development opportunities we may engage in for our
programs and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments, which include corporate,
financial institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations, or hold
them in cash."

common units (or 7,264,083 common units if the underwriters exercise their
overallotment option in full) directly from i3 Verticals, LLC, and (2) 383,417
common units from a Continuing Equity Owner, in each case at a price per common
unit equal to the price per share paid by the underwriters for shares of our
Class A common stock in this offering.

i3 Verticals, LLC will receive an estimated $74.8 million in net proceeds from
the sale of common units to i3 Verticals, Inc. (together with any additional
proceeds it may receive if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option), after deducting estimated offering expenses of $0.9 million (which do
not include $2.4 million of previously paid offering expenses). i3 Verticals,
LLC intends to use these net proceeds as follows:

• to repay the Mezzanine Notes in full;

• to repay the outstanding Junior Subordinated Notes in full; and

• to repay approximately $56.3 million of the revolving loan of our Senior
  Secured Credit Facility (or approximately $68.5 million if the underwriters
  exercise their overallotment option in full).

In addition, we intend to repay approximately $2.8 million of the revolving loan
of our Senior Secured Credit Facility with the amounts we receive from the

As of March 31, 2018, we owed $10.5 million under the Mezzanine Notes, which
bear a fixed interest rate of 12.0% per annum and mature on November 29, 2020.
We used the proceeds from the issuance of the Mezzanine Notes to fund certain of
our acquisitions and for working capital.

As of March 31, 2018, we owed $16.1 million under the Junior Subordinated Notes,
which bear a fixed interest rate of 10.0% per annum and mature on the later of
(a) February 14, 2019, or (b) the maturity date of the later to mature of (i)
the Mezzanine Notes and (ii) the Senior Secured Credit Facility. We used the
proceeds from the issuance of the Junior Subordinated Notes to fund an

to a voluntary private conversion of Junior Subordinated Notes by certain
related and unrelated creditors of i3 Verticals, LLC. In this conversion,
certain eligible holders of Junior Subordinated Notes have elected to convert
approximately $8.1 million in aggregate indebtedness into Class A common stock.
As a result, the net proceeds from this offering will be used to repay the
remaining balance of these certain Junior Subordinated Notes, or approximately
$8.1 million.

As of March 31, 2018, under our Senior Secured Credit Facility, we owed $37.5
million under our term loan and $70.8 million under our revolving loan. Our
Senior Secured Credit Facility matures on the earlier of October 30, 2022 or 181
days before the maturity date of the Mezzanine Notes. As of March 31, 2018, the
interest rate on the borrowings outstanding under our term loan was 5.88% per
annum and under our revolving loan was 5.77% per annum.

As a result of the repayment of all remaining indebtedness outstanding under the
Junior Subordinated Notes and the Mezzanine Notes, our affiliates will receive
approximately $13.7 million of the net proceeds from this offering, based on
amounts outstanding under the Junior Subordinated Notes and the Mezzanine Notes."

$66.0 million (or approximately $76.4 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase up to 750,000 additional shares of common stock to
cover over-allotments), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets by us, our employees and
our stockholders, obtain additional capital to support our operations and
increase our visibility in the marketplace.

As of March 31, 2018, we had cash and cash equivalents of $47.1 million. We
currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $20 million to advance KZR-616 for the treatment of lupus and
  lupus nephritis through our KZR-616-002 Phase 1b/2 clinical trial;         

. approximately $14 million to advance KZR-616 for the treatment of idiopathic
  inflammatory myopathies and up to three additional autoimmune indications into
  a Phase 1b or Phase 2 clinical trial;  

. approximately $14 million to advance discovery and preclinical development in
  our protein secretion program; and  

. the remainder to fund other research and development activities, working   
  capital and other general corporate purposes.                              

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire
or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.
However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based on our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Further, due
to the uncertainties inherent in the drug development process, it is difficult
to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this
offering that may be used for the above purposes.

Our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds from
this offering, and our investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical
trials we may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions and
the amount of cash obtained through current and any future collaborations.

The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our product candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of our product candidates. We
expect to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings and potential collaborations, and license and development agreements.
We have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and
we could expend our available capital resources at a rate greater than we
currently expect.

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation
instruments, including short-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States government."

Eldridge private placement will be approximately $542.7 million, or $606.9
million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other
estimated expenses. We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering and
the concurrent private placement of common stock to our operating partnership in
exchange for OP units.

We expect our operating partnership to use the net proceeds received from us and
in the concurrent private placement of OP units (if any) (i) to repay short-term
notes, with an aggregate principal balance of approximately $288.0 million as of
June 1, 2018, issued to an affiliate of Eldridge and (ii) for general corporate
purposes, including potential future investments. The indebtedness to be repaid
to an affiliate of Eldridge was incurred to acquire properties. These short-term
notes accrue interest at an annual rate equal to LIBOR plus a spread of between
2.14% and 2.55% (with a weighted average annual interest rate of 3.83% as of
March 31, 2018) and mature on various dates throughout 2018 and 2019 (with a
weighted average maturity of 245 days, as of March 31, 2018).

Pending the permanent use of the net proceeds from these offerings, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, short-term investment-grade
securities, money-market accounts or other investments that are consistent with
our intention to qualify for taxation as a REIT for federal income tax purposes."

this offering will be approximately $89.8 million, or $103.8 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, and
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

As of March 31, 2018, we had approximately $41.5 million in cash and cash
equivalents. In April 2018, we received gross proceeds of $52.3 million from the
sale of our Series C redeemable convertible preferred stock. We intend to use
the net proceeds from this offering and our cash and cash equivalents on hand as
follows:

• Approximately $39.0 million to fund the development of our lead conditioning
  programs and related product candidates, including GMP manufacturing and
  completing IND enabling studies for our lead conditioning program;

• Approximately $14.0 million to fund development of MGTA-456, including the
  completion of our ongoing Phase II clinical trial in patients with inherited
  metabolic diseases, initiation of a pivotal clinical trial for inherited
  metabolic diseases, evaluation of additional indications beyond inherited
  metabolic diseases such as sickle cell disease and blood cancers, and planned
  expansion of our late stage clinical and early commercial manufacturing
  capabilities through third parties;

• Approximately $9.0 million to fund the development of MGTA-145, including GMP
  manufacturing, initiation and completion of a first-in-human study and
  initiation of a proof-of-concept clinical trial; and

• The remaining proceeds, if any, to fund new and ongoing research and
  development activities, our new product engine, working capital and other
  general corporate purposes, which may include funding for the hiring of
  additional personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of operating as a
  public company.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, together
with the net proceeds to us from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through at least the first quarter of 2020.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in new businesses, technology or assets. Although we have no specific
agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any in-license or
acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities and engage in related discussions
with other companies from time to time.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our preclinical and clinical
development activities may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and results
from preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trial or any clinical trials
we may commence in the future, our ability to take advantage of expedited
programs or to obtain regulatory approval for MGTA-456 and any other product
candidates we may identify and pursue, the timing and costs associated with the
manufacture and supply of MGTA-456 and any other product candidates we may
identify and pursue for clinical development or commercialization, and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

this offering will be approximately $90.5 million, or approximately $104.4
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based
upon the initial public offering price of $19.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents of $57.9 million as of
March 31, 2018, as follows:

• approximately $13.4 million to fund expenses for our lead product candidate,
  AVR-RD-01, for the treatment of Fabry disease in our ongoing Phase 2 clinical
  trial and to support the ongoing investigator-sponsored Phase 1 clinical 
  trial;                                                   

• approximately $12.9 million to fund expenses to advance AVR-RD-02 for the 
  treatment of Gaucher disease into Phase 1/2 clinical trials;              

• approximately $3.2 million to fund expenses to advance AVR-RD-03 for Pompe
  disease further into preclinical development;                             

• approximately $5.4 million to fund expenses to advance AVR-RD-04 for the  
  treatment of cystinosis, including to support the planned initial         
  investigator-sponsored Phase 1/2 clinical trial;                          

• approximately $28.0 million to fund expenses for our external and internal
  manufacturing and process development activities related to the advancement
  of our product candidates;                                    

• approximately $32.6 million to fund research and development activities that
  relate to all of our clinical and preclinical activities, including the cost
  of research and development personnel; and                       

• the remainder for planned general and administrative expenses, the costs of 
  operating as a public company, working capital and other general corporate
  purposes.                                                       

Based on our current plans, we expect that the proceeds allocated as described
above will be sufficient to complete the ongoing Phase 1 and Phase 2 clinical
trials for AVR-RD-01, but will be insufficient to complete the above referenced
trials and studies for AVR-RD-02, AVR-RD-03 and AVR-RD-04 or subsequent clinical
trials of AVR-RD-01. Based on our current plans, we believe our existing cash
and cash equivalents, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to fund our operations into 2020.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. For example, we
may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses or
technologies to continue to build our pipeline, our research and development
capabilities and our intellectual property position, although we currently have
no agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any such
transaction. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the timing and plans for initiation of our planned clinical trials,
the progress of our research and development, the status of and results from
non-clinical studies or clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well
as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates or strategic opportunities that become available to us, and any
unforeseen cash needs.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending these uses, we plan to hold these net proceeds in non-interest bearing
accounts, with the goal of capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds
are readily available to fund our operations."

    the acquisition of a target business would either come from the funds held
    in the trust account or additional funds otherwise available to us outside
    of the trust account, including cash held by the target business. Any
    remaining funds will be disbursed to the combined company and be used as
    working capital to finance the operations of the target business.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $500,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor has agreed to purchase an aggregate of 475,000 private units at a
price of $10.00 per private unit ($4,750,000 in the aggregate) in a private
placement that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. It
has further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, it will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per private unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 54,000 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.00 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. These
additional private units will be purchased in a private placement that will
occur simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of
the over-allotment option. All of the proceeds we receive from these purchases
will be placed in the trust account described below.

$180,000,000, or $207,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. in the United States,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern
the investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. to invest the funds as set forth in such
written instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income or
other tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

We will be obligated, commencing on the date of this prospectus, to pay Twelve
Seas Capital, Inc., an affiliate of our Chief Executive Officer, a monthly fee
of an aggregate of $10,000 for general and administrative services including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the
trust account to our public shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee
and the repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which payments will be made
from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust account prior to the
completion of our initial business combination), no compensation of any kind
(including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of
our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of their affiliates,
prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the
consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction
that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$500,000. We may use the working capital available for miscellaneous expenses
such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the
balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our initial shareholders, officers and directors in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above. We will also be entitled to have
interest earned on the funds held in the trust account released to us to pay any
tax obligations that we may owe.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto. If the
payment of our liabilities, including the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal
to 3.5% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any
applicable finders’ fees which might become payable), were to reduce the amount
available to us in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or
sell their shares to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we
would not be able to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share
capital is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business
combination, the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to
consummate a business combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their
shares into a portion of the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses
relating thereto (which could include the up to $7,245,000 payable to
EarlyBirdCapital described above if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full) will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other
net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations
of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of
ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing
or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Bryant Edwards has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $20,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of June 18, 2018, our sponsor had loaned to us an aggregate of $300,000 to be
used to pay formation and a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loan
is payable without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial
public offering. If we determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts
would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued
units to acquire 55,000 ordinary shares (which includes 5,000 shares issuable
upon conversion of rights) and warrants to purchase 50,000 ordinary shares if
$500,000 of notes were so converted). If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us for our tax obligations) only in the
event of (i) our liquidation if we have not completed a business combination
within the required time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such
public shares or sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection
with a business combination which we consummate or in connection with an
amendment to our memorandum and articles of association prior to the
consummation of an initial business combination. In no other circumstances will
a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses, including an aggregate of $100,000 paid
    to B. Prot Conseil, an entity controlled by Mr. Baudouin Prot, our Chairman,
    for the period September 2017 through the closing of the initial public
    offering, will be paid from the proceeds of a loan from our sponsor of up to
    $500,000 as described in this prospectus. This amount will be repaid upon
    completion of this offering out of the $1,550,000 of offering proceeds that
    has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than
    underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust account.
    In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this table,
    any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital expenses. In
    the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth in this
    table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $4,725,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or $5,433,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

(6) A monthly payment of $12,500 has been paid to B. Prot Conseil, an entity
    controlled by Mr. Baudouin Prot, since September 2017 and the amount of
    $225,000 reflects monthly payments of $12,500 through December 2019. This
    Agreement with B. Prot Conseil will last through the earlier of December
    2019 and the closing of the initial business combination.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $137,700,000 (or $158,355,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $4,725,000 (or $5,433,750
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $1,000,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.8% per year; however, we can provide no assurance regarding
this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has loaned us $460,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the
earlier of December 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

Our anchor investor has expressed to us an interest to purchase $13.365 million
of public units in this offering and we have agreed to direct the underwriters
to sell to our anchor investor such number of public units. Further, the anchor
investor has agreed with us that, if it does not own a minimum of 1,336,500
public shares (which amount will be reduced on a pro rata basis if less than
13,500,000 units are sold in this offering) at the time of any stockholder vote
with respect to an initial business combination or the business day immediately
prior to the consummation of our initial business combination, it will forfeit
all or a portion of the 267,300 founder shares it purchased prior to this
offering on a pro rata basis. In such a case, our sponsor (or its designee),
will repurchase on a pro rata basis the private placement warrants held by our
anchor investor at its original purchase price. There can be no assurance that
the anchor investor will acquire any public units in this offering or what
amount of equity the anchor investor will retain, if any, upon the consummation
of our initial business combination. As a result of the founder shares and
private placement warrants that our anchor investor may hold, it may have
different interests with respect to a vote on an initial business combination
than other public stockholders.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."
"EIDOS THERAPEUTICS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/eidos-therapeutics-inc-1050668-86995,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/eidos-therapeutics-inc-1050668-86995,424B4,6/21/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12825313,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 6,250,000 shares of our
common stock in this offering will be approximately $96.0 million, or $110.8
million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase 937,500
additional shares, based on an initial public offering price of $17.00 per
share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• Approximately 80% of the net proceeds will be used to fund our clinical 
  development of AG10 for the treatment of ATTR-CM and ATTR-PN, including our
  ongoing Phase 2 ATTR-CM and planned Phase 3 ATTR-PN clinical trials, as well
  as future clinical trials and additional research and development activities;
  and

• The remaining proceeds will be used for working capital and general corporate 
  purposes.                                                                     

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in new businesses, technology or assets. Although we have no current agreements,
commitments or understandings with respect to any such in-license or
acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities and engage in related discussions
with third parties from time to time.

We estimate that our current cash, along with the net proceeds from this
offering, will be sufficient for us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months, including through
the completion of our ongoing Phase 2 and planned Phase 3 clinical trials of
AG10. However, the net proceeds from this offering, together with our current
cash, will not be sufficient for us to fund the development of AG10 through
regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to complete
the development and commercialization of AG10. At this time, we cannot predict
with certainty the amount of capital needed to complete the development and
commercialization of AG10, but we anticipate seeking additional capital in the
future to fund such capital needs through further equity offerings and/or debt
borrowings, or through collaboration agreements, strategic alliances, licensing
arrangements or marketing and distribution arrangements. We cannot guarantee
that we will be able to raise additional capital on reasonable terms or at all.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our research
and development activities may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and results
from any preclinical or clinical trials we may commence in the future, our
ability to take advantage of expedited programs or to obtain regulatory approval
for any other product candidates we may identify and pursue, the timing and
costs associated with the manufacture and supply of any other product candidates
we may identify and pursue for clinical development or commercialization, and
any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

We intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation
investments, including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
instruments and U.S. government securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of
    June 18, 2018, we had borrowed $277,600 under the promissory note with our
    sponsor. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of
    the $1,750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment 
    of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not 
    to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are 
    less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering 
    expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess
    with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial 
    business combination, $7,875,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in
    the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released by the 
    trustee to pay redeeming shareholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. If the
    underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised, an additional 5.5% of the
    gross proceeds from the over-allotment ($0.55 per unit or up to $1,856,250
    in the aggregate) will be deposited in the trust account as deferred 
    underwriting commissions. The underwriters will not be entitled to any 
    interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include
    amounts related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed
    estimates.

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately
    $3,150,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in
    the trust account over 12 months following the investment of such funds in
    specified U.S. Government Treasury bills, however, we can provide no 
    assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes no exercise of the 
    underwriters’ overallotment option and an interest rate of 1.4% per annum 
    based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be 
    invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection 
    with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate
    of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not
    obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial
    business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds
    of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid
    only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our 
    initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the 
    working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
    but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned 
    amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants at
    a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The 
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of 
    our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written 
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans 
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do 
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a 
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust 
    account.

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from
this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the
net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$227,250,000 (or $261,337,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $7,875,000 (or up to $9,731,250 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $3,150,000 per year, assuming
no exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option and an interest rate of
1.4% per year, following the investment of such funds in specified U.S.
government treasury bills or in specified money market funds. We will not be
permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account
except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, the proceeds from
this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be
released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our
initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering
or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or
pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18
months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.
            
The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital. There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or
through loans in connection with our initial business combination, including
pursuant to the contingent forward purchase contract described herein.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of June
18, 2018, we had borrowed $277,600 under the promissory note with our sponsor.
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
December 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid
upon the closing of this offering out of the $1,750,000 of offering proceeds not
held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our
officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from
parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any such 
transaction may be different than the amount per share a public shareholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, 
they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any 
material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases
are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently 
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the 
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial business combination (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our initial business combination may require as a closing condition that we have
a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public shareholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to (A) modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering or (B)
with respect to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or
pre-business combination activity and (iii) the redemption of all of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our initial business combination within 18
months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares and any public shares they may hold in
connection with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition,
our sponsor, officers and directors have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors
or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to
such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination
within the prescribed time frame."
VERRICA PHARMACEUTICALS INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/verrica-pharmaceuticals-inc-981776-86947,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/verrica-pharmaceuticals-inc-981776-86947,424B4,6/15/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12816400,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our issuance and sale of 5,000,000 shares
of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $68.0 million (or
$78.4 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares) after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $61.0 million to complete our planned clinical trials, seek
  regulatory approval and fund the commercial launch, if approved, of VP-102 for
  the treatment of molluscum;                                  

• approximately $12.0 million to advance the clinical development of VP-102 for
  the treatment of common warts; and                           

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
  including to develop VP-103 and VP-102 for additional indications and to
  pursue our strategy to develop, in-license or acquire additional product
  candidates, although we have no agreements or commitments for any specific
  acquisitions or in-licenses as of the date of this prospectus. 

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, will enable us to fund our operations for at least
the next 24 months, including the completion of our planned clinical trials,
submission of NDAs and commercial launch, if approved, of VP-102 for the
treatment of molluscum as well as the completion of our ongoing clinical trial
of VP-102 for the treatment of common warts. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we expect. With respect to our clinical development of
VP-102 for common warts and additional indications and our clinical development
of VP-103, we expect that we will require additional funds as these programs
progress, the amounts of which will depend on the ultimate clinical development
paths we pursue.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. Predicting the costs necessary to develop product candidates
can be difficult. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of those net proceeds. The timing and
amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash
flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States."

approximately US$108.8 million if the over-allotment option is not exercised,
and US$125.9 million if the over-allotment option is exercised, based on the
initial public offering price of US$17.00 per ADS, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We anticipate using the net proceeds of this offering for the following
purposes:

• approximately 70% for financing potential strategic acquisitions and launch of
  new schools in China;                                           

• approximately 15% for upgrading our information technology systems and
  promoting online platforms;                                               

• approximately 10% for marketing and brand promotion; and

• the remaining amount to fund working capital and for other general corporate
  purposes.                                                       

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus.

In utilizing the proceeds from this offering, we are permitted under PRC laws
and regulations to provide funding to our PRC subsidiaries only through loans or
capital contributions, and to our VIE and its subsidiaries only through loans,
and only if we satisfy the applicable government registration and approval
requirements. Under the PRC laws and regulations, capital contributions to our
PRC subsidiaries are required to be filed with the Ministry of Commerce or its
local counterparts and also be registered with the local banks authorized by the
State Administration of Foreign Exchange of the PRC, or the SAFE. Any loan that
we provide our PRC subsidiaries, our VIE and its subsidiaries may not exceed a
statutory limit and is required to be filed with the SAFE after the loan
agreement is signed and at least three business days prior to any drawdown by
the borrower under the loan. Although it usually takes no more than 30 days to
complete or receive aforesaid governmental filings, registrations or approvals
after submission of all required application documents, we cannot assure you
that we will be able to complete or obtain these governmental filings,
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $163.9
million, based upon the initial public offering price of $24.00 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in
full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us will be approximately $189.0
million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, improve brand awareness, create a public market for our common
stock, and facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. We intend
to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for general corporate
purposes, which we currently expect will include headcount expansion, continued
investment in our sales and marketing efforts, product development, general and
administrative matters, and working capital. We also intend to use a portion of
the net proceeds from this offering to repay the outstanding balance under our
revolving credit facility. As of March 31, 2018, we had $28.0 million
outstanding under our revolving credit facility bearing interest at an annual
rate of 6.50%. On May 29, 2018, we borrowed an additional $5.0 million under our
revolving credit facility. The revolving credit facility must be repaid in
November 2019. We borrowed approximately $26.0 million under the revolving
credit facility in the twelve months ended March 31, 2018 and used the proceeds
from such borrowings, as well as the additional borrowing on May 29, 2018, for
general corporate purposes, including working capital. In addition to other
investments in our growth strategies, we may also use a portion of the net
proceeds that we receive to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,
products, services, technologies, or other assets. However, we have not entered
into any agreements or commitments with respect to any specific acquisitions or
investments at this time.

We cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds
that we will receive from this offering and have not quantified or allocated any
specific portion of the net proceeds or range of net proceeds to any particular
purpose. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.
Furthermore, the amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on
numerous factors, including the cash used in or generated by our operations, the
status of our development, the level of our sales and marketing activities, the
pace of our international expansion plans, and our investments and acquisitions.
Pending the use of proceeds as described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds that we receive in short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing
obligations, investment-grade investments, certificates of deposit, or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the
invested proceeds will yield a favorable return."

of our common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use approximately
$40.0 million of the net proceeds to repay borrowings outstanding under the Term
Loan and any remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes. We have not
yet made final decisions with respect to our use of the remaining proceeds for
general corporate purposes, though we may use such proceeds to fund our 2018
capital program, identify and develop new services offerings or pursue
acquisitions. We cannot currently allocate specific percentages of the net
proceeds that we may use for such purposes. Until we use our net proceeds of the
offering, we intend to invest the funds in United States government securities
and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments or
high-grade corporate notes. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling stockholders.

Our Term Loan matures on October 25, 2024. As of March 31, 2018, $245.3 million
was outstanding under the Term Loan, which bears interest, at our option, at
1-month, 2-month or 3-month LIBOR or any combination thereof, plus 6.25% (8.2%
as of March 31, 2018). Approximately $130.0 million and $120.0 million of the
outstanding borrowings under the Term Loan were incurred to repay indebtedness
and to make cash distributions to our Existing Owners, respectively."

$245.2 million at the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and unpaid estimated offering
expenses of $4.8 million payable by us.

In connection with, and contingent upon, this offering, we intend to enter into
the New Revolver and the New Term Loan. We expect to have $31.3 million
outstanding under the New Revolver immediately after this offering. We do not
expect to have any amounts outstanding under the New Revolver immediately after
this offering. We expect the New Term Loan to be in the face amount of $200.0
million. The closing of this offering is not conditioned on the consummation of
the New Revolver or the New Term Loan. We cannot assure you that the New
Revolver or the New Term Loan will be completed on the terms described in this
prospectus or at all.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows: (a)
approximately $237.7 million to repay (i) our existing term loan facility,
including breakage fees, (ii) a portion of the borrowings outstanding under our
existing revolving credit facility and (iii) the 2007 Restated Term Note and (b)
approximately $7.5 million for the purchase of the Tunnel Hill, Georgia, real
estate we historically have leased from Q&F Realty, a related party, for $7.5
million. Our existing $275.0 million term loan facility had $192.5 million
outstanding at March 31, 2018. The existing term loan facility has a maturity
date of May 30, 2020 and bears interest at LIBOR plus an applicable margin of
10.0% to 11.5%. Our existing revolving credit facility had $49.1 million in
outstanding borrowings and $35.1 million in letters of credit at March 31, 2018.
The existing revolving credit facility bears interest dependent on the excess
availability on the facility at the base rate plus an applicable margin of 0.50%
to 1.00% or LIBOR plus an applicable margin of 1.50% to 2.00%.

The 2007 Restated Term Note is unsecured, matures in November 2020 and bears
interest at 13.0% per annum, the rate calculated as if the highest applicable 
margin under our existing term loan facility were in effect, and is held in part
by certain related parties. The Tunnel Hill, Georgia, real estate was appraised
by an independent third-party appraiser at $8.5 million.

We expect to use the net proceeds of the New Term Loan and the New Revolver as 
follows: (a) to repay a portion of our equipment installment notes, (b) to repay
any remaining borrowings outstanding under our existing revolving credit
facility, (c) for fees and expenses incurred in connection with the entry into
the New Credit Facilities and (d) for general corporate purposes, including, but
not limited to, the purchase of tractors and trailers scheduled for delivery in
2018 and other general corporate purposes. At March 31, 2018, the equipment
financing notes had weighted average interest rate of approximately 4.8% per
annum, an aggregate outstanding principal balance of $302.8 million and maturity
dates through August 2022.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders but have agreed to pay certain expenses incurred by the selling
stockholders in connection with the sale."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.                                                                 

(2) Includes an aggregate of 4,000,000 units to be purchased, directly or        
    indirectly, by funds managed or advised by Third Point in this offering.     

(3) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan  
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. This     
    amount will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the offering   
    proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other 
    than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in the trust
    account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in this
    table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as set forth
    in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the trust
    account.                   

(4) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, up to $17,850,000 of deferred commissions (or          
    $20,737,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) 
    will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account,   
    and the remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay         
    redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or 
    a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our 
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,       
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in       
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of   
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled
    to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and           
    commissions. The underwriters will not receive underwriting commissions on   
    units purchased by funds managed or advised by Third Point in this offering. 

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.               

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $550,000,000 (or $632,500,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $17,850,000 (or
$20,737,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee, and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $8,250,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 1.5% per year;
however, we can provide no assurance regarding this amount. Except with respect
to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released
to us to pay our tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account
until the earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business
combination, (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months (or 27 months from the closing of this offering if
we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement for our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering but have not completed our initial business combination within
such 24 month period) from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to
any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business
combination activity, unless we provide our public stockholders with the
opportunity to redeem their shares of Class A common stock upon approval of any
such amendment at a per-share price, payable in cash, equal to the aggregate
amount then on deposit in the trust account, including interest (which interest
shall be net of taxes payable released to us) divided by the number of then
outstanding public shares, and (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months (or 27
months, as applicable) from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable
law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt instruments, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. This loan will be non-interest bearing, unsecured and
is due at the earlier of December 31, 2018 or the closing of this offering. The
loan will be repaid out of proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our directors and officers may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our directors and officers, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a forward purchase agreement with the forward purchaser
pursuant to which it has agreed to purchase forward purchase shares for $9.50
per forward purchase share in a private placement that will close simultaneously
with the closing of our initial business combination. The actual number of
forward purchase shares to be purchased will be a number of shares (rounded up
to the nearest whole share) equal to (A) the excess of the number of shares of
Class A common stock that are redeemed from holders in connection with our
initial business combination (which redemptions are not revoked prior to the
date of our initial business combination) over 20,000,000, multiplied by (B) a
fraction, the numerator of which is $10.00 and the denominator of which is
$9.50. The forward purchase shares are identical to the shares of Class A common
stock included in the units being sold in this offering, except that the forward
purchase shares are subject to transfer restrictions and certain registration
rights, as described herein.  

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation (A) to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months (or 27 months from the closing of this offering if
we have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive
agreement for our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing
of this offering but have not completed our initial business combination within
such 24 month period) from the closing of this offering or (B) with respect to
any other provision relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial business
combination activity, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our business combination within 24 months (or 27 months, as
applicable) following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law
and as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited
to cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, directors, director nominees and officers have entered into a
letter agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to their founder shares and any public shares
held by them in connection with the completion of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to any
founder shares held by them if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

ordinary shares in this offering will be approximately $67.0 million, based on
an initial public offering price of $15.00 per ordinary share and after
deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares from us is exercised in full, we estimate that our net
proceeds will be approximately $77.5 million.

We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering, together with
cash and cash equivalents of $32.4 million as of March 31, 2018, for the
following purposes:

• approximately $20 million to $25 million to further develop our most advanced
  product candidates, AAV-CNGB3, AAV-CNGA3, AAV-RPGR, AAV-RPE65 and AAV-AQP1
  through completion of Phase 1/2 trials;                    

• approximately $10 million to $15 million to scale up our manufacturing
  facility and related processes;                                         

• approximately $10 million to $15 million to fund research and development of
  our other pipeline product candidates and technologies; and               

• the remainder, if any, to fund pivotal trials for AAV-CNGB3, AAV-CNGA3, 
  AAV-RPGR and AAV-RPE65, new and ongoing research and development activities
  and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets, although currently we have no
specific agreements, commitments or understandings in this regard. As of the
date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or
the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Predicting
the cost necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and we
anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete the development of any
product candidates we identify. The amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development
efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies and any ongoing
clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash and cash equivalents, we estimate that such funds will be sufficient to
enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
through the third quarter of 2020. We have based this estimate on assumptions
that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources
sooner than we currently expect. We may satisfy our future cash needs through
the sale of equity securities, debt financings, working capital lines of credit,
corporate collaborations or license agreements, grant funding, interest income
earned on invested cash balances or a combination of one or more of these
sources.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from an affiliate of our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this
    prospectus. As of March 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under
    such promissory note. Subsequent to March 31, 2018, we borrowed $300,000
    under such promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
    offering. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of
    the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions) not held in the
    trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $21,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’      
    deferred commissions (or up to $24,150,000 if the underwriters’ option to   
    purchase additional units is exercised in full) will be paid to the         
    underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining     
    funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the 
    purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial business
    combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of  
    principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our       
    initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or   
    for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest  
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) Includes organizational and administrative expenses and may include amounts
    related to above-listed expenses in the event actual amounts exceed     
    estimates.                       

(5) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately     
    $6,000,000 to be available to us annually from interest earned on the funds
    held in the trust account; however, we can provide no assurances regarding
    this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 1.0% per annum based
    upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may be
    invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection
    with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of
    our sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,    
    loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
    combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the
    trust account released to us. In the event that our initial business
    combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
    outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from
    our trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to         
    $1,500,000 of such loans made to us more than 90 days after the date of this
    prospectus may be convertible into warrants at a price of $1.50 per warrant
    at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
    placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans, if any,
    have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to 
    such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our   
    sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any,
    as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and
    provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
    trust account.                               

(6) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment
    fees for financing.                        

The rules of NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $600,000,000 (or $690,000,000 if the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional units is exercised in full), including $21,000,000 (or up to
$24,150,000 if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional units is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the
consummation of this offering, be placed in a U.S. based trust account at
Wilmington Trust, N.A., with Wilmington Trust, N.A. acting as trustee. The funds
in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in
U.S. Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $6,000,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 1.0% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw
any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except with respect
to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released
to us to pay our taxes, if any, the funds held in the trust account will not be
released from the trust account until the earliest of: (1) the completion of our
initial business combination; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering; and
(3) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we expect that
interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination or used for redemption of our public shares, we may apply
the balance of the cash released to us from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of
post-transaction businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital. There is no limitation
on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans in connection with our
initial business combination.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their respective affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation or
other duty to loan funds to, or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, an affiliate of our sponsor has agreed to
loan us up to $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
offering. As of March 31, 2018, there were no amounts outstanding under such
promissory note. Subsequent to March 31, 2018, we borrowed $300,000 under such
promissory note to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of
December 31, 2018 and the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid
upon completion of this offering out of the $1,000,000 of offering proceeds that
has been allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting
commissions) not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as
may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. In
the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may use a
portion of the working capital held outside the trust account to repay such
loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay
such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans made to us more than 90 days
after the date of this prospectus may be convertible into warrants at a price of
$1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical
to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans
by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors, if
any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to
such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor,
an affiliate of our sponsor or our officers and directors, if any, as we do not
believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver
against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their respective affiliates may also purchase shares in privately
negotiated transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the
completion of our initial business combination. The price per share paid in any
such transaction may be different than the amount per share a public stockholder
would receive if it elected to redeem its shares in connection with our initial
business combination. However, such persons have no current commitments, plans
or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any terms
or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such transactions,
they will be restricted from making any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we do not then become subject to the SEC’s “penny
stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require
as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of
cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that
we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (1) the completion of our initial business
combination and then, only in connection with those public shares that such
stockholder has properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
in this prospectus; (2) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering; and (3) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders, officers and directors have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to (1) waive their
redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and any public shares held
by them in connection with the completion of our initial business combination
and (2) waive their redemption rights with respect to any founder shares and
public shares held by them in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an
amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
have not consummated our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering. In addition, our initial stockholders, officers and
directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by them if we fail to
complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers or directors acquires public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."
AMBOW EDUCATION HOLDING LTD.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ambow-education-holding-ltd-832935-84606,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/ambow-education-holding-ltd-832935-84606,424B4,6/1/2018,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12792745,"We estimate that our proceeds from this offering, net of underwriting discounts
and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us and assuming
no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option, will be approximately
US$6.20 million, based on a public offering price of US$4.25 per ADS.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate
purposes, including to upgrade and expand our schools and learning centers,
teacher training programs and research and development of our educational
content and to fund working capital of Bay State College. To the extent that the
net proceeds we receive from this offering are not immediately applied for the
above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing instruments or bank deposits. By reason of such investments it
is possible that we may become a PFIC for U.S. federal income tax purposes,
which could result in adverse U.S. federal income tax consequence to U.S.
Holders of our ADSs or ordinary shares. 

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering we, as an offshore holding company,
are permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to our PRC
subsidiary through loans or capital contributions and to our consolidated
affiliated entities through loans. Subject to satisfaction of applicable
government registration and approval requirements, we may extend inter-company
loans to our PRC subsidiaries, VIEs and their respective VIEs or subsidiaries or
make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries to fund their
capital expenditures or working capital, as was the case when we received U.S.
dollar proceeds from our initial public offering in 2010 and extended such
inter-company loans and capital contributions. Based on our previous experience
and current discussions with relevant parties, we expect it will take six to
twelve months to obtain registrations and approvals from SAFE or its local
counterparts to extend such intercompany loans or make such capital
contributions to our PRC subsidiaries with the proceeds of this Offering.
Accordingly, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these
government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."
