indebtedness under a $550 million, 364-day credit facility with a

          of which $41.5 million will be loaned by Provident Financial Services,
          Inc. to the ESOP to fund its purchase of common stock and $20.7

corporate purposes, including possibly the repurchase of shares of our common

         The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
conversion may be more or less than our estimates. Payments for shares made
through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result in the
receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of Clay
County Savings' deposits. In all instances, Clay County Savings will receive 50%
of the net proceeds of the offering. CCSB Financial Corp. intends to loan to the
employee stock ownership plan the amount necessary to acquire 8% of the common
stock issued in the conversion.

         We are undertaking the conversion and offering at this time in order to
have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our business. The
offering proceeds will increase our capital and the amount of funds available to
us for lending and investment. The proceeds will also give us greater
flexibility to diversify operations and expand the products and services we
offer.


CCSB Financial Corp. may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

         .    to finance the expansion of its operations through the
              acquisition of financial institutions, or through diversification
              into related financial services businesses, although no specific
              transactions are being considered at this time;

         .    to invest in securities;

         .    to repurchase its common stock;

         .    to pay dividends to stockholders; and

         .    for general corporate purposes.

         Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not
repurchase shares of common stock during the first year following the
conversion, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior
regulatory approval.

Clay County Savings may use the proceeds it receives from the offering:

         .    to fund new loans, including one-to four-family mortgage loans,
              construction loans, multi-family and commercial real estate
              loans, consumer loans and commercial loans;

         .    to expand its retail banking franchise, by establishing or
              acquiring new branches or by acquiring other financial
              institutions, or other financial services companies, although no
              transactions are specifically being considered at this time;

         .    to invest in securities; and

         .    for general corporate purposes.


         Initially, it is expected that the net proceeds retained by CCSB
Financial Corp., and received by Clay County Savings, will be placed in
short-term investments.

         We will have broad discretion in allocating the proceeds of the
offering. Although our intended uses of proceeds are set forth above, we have
not allocated specific amounts of proceeds for any of these purposes and we will
have significant flexibility in determining the amount of net proceeds we apply
to different uses and the timing of such applications. Our failure to utilize
these funds effectively could reduce our profitability."

         The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
reorganization and stock offering may be more or less than our estimates. For
example, our expenses would increase if a syndicated community offering is used
to sell shares not purchased in the subscription offering and community
offering. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of shares to be sold in
the stock offering is adjusted to reflect a change in the estimated pro forma
market value of Oswego County Bancorp and Oswego County Savings Bank. Payments
for shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not
result in the receipt of new funds for investment by Oswego County Savings Bank
but will result in a reduction of Oswego County Savings Bank's deposits and
interest expense as funds are transferred from interest bearing certificates of
deposit or other deposit accounts.

Oswego County National Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the stock
offering:


          to increase lending, especially to support the continued growth in its
          commercial loan portfolio;

          to establish or acquire new branches;

          to finance the acquisition of financial institutions or other
          businesses related to banking, although no mergers or acquisitions are
          planned at the present time;

          to enhance the quality of its facilities so that it may better serve
          the needs of its customers; and

investments and mortgage-backed securities until these proceeds can be deployed
for the purposes discussed above."

discount and our estimated offering expenses are estimated to be approximately
$202.1 million (assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option)
or approximately $232.9 million (assuming the full exercise of the underwriters'
over-allotment option). We intend to use these proceeds to provide additional
capital to our subsidiaries, to repay a portion of the outstanding debt under
our credit facilities and for other general corporate purposes.
 
       As of December 31, 2002, we had $192 million of principal outstanding
under our term loan facility. Of these borrowings, $100 million was used to
purchase equity interests in the Company previously owned by Zurich. See
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations -- Significant Transactions."" The remaining $92 million was used as
part of the contribution we made to Endurance Bermuda in December 2002, which in
turn made contributions to Endurance U.S. and Endurance U.K. as part of their
initial capitalization.
 
       Currently, $100 million outstanding under the term loan facility bears
interest at the rate of 2.81% per annum; the remaining $92 million outstanding
under the term loan facility bears interest at 2.50% per annum. Under the
current terms of the term loan facility, we must apply 25% of the net cash
proceeds, up to a maximum of $55 million, of any sale of equity securities we or
any of our subsidiaries may issue to the repayment of outstanding principal
under the term loan facility. Assuming net proceeds of approximately $202.1
million (assuming no exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option), upon
consummation of this offering we plan to apply $50.5 million (or up to $55
million assuming exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option) of such
proceeds to the repayment of principal under the term loan facility.
 
       We have $20.0 million (20% of our first term loan borrowing of $100
million) and $18.4 million (20% of our second term loan borrowing of $92
million) in principal payments due and payable by September 27, 2003 and
September 30, 2003, respectively, for outstanding borrowings on our term loan
facility. We anticipate using a combination of the proceeds from this offering
and dividends from Endurance Bermuda to make such principal payments. Our
remaining term loan borrowings are subject to principal amortization of 40% per
annum by September 27, 2004 and 2005, respectively, on our first term loan
borrowing and 40% per annum by September 30, 2004 and 2005, respectively, on our
second term loan borrowing."

We intend
to use  $2,900,000  of these  proceeds to acquire  Florida  Trust  Company  from
Citizens National.  We will use the balance of the proceeds to provide increased
capital  for our bank  subsidiaries  and to expand  through the  acquisition  of
another bank, the formation of a new bank in a targeted  market,  or through the
opening of additional  branch offices for our wholly-owned  subsidiary banks. We
will  consider  market  location,  price  and  base  of  target  customers  when
evaluating the purchase of any branch offices.

     We will have significant discretion regarding when the net proceeds will be
applied toward the expansion of our business.  In the event our expansion  plans
are delayed or curtailed for any reason,  we will deploy the net proceeds of the
offering in alternative  investments,  such as loans or securities,  in order to
maximize  returns.  We  believe  that  the  offering  proceeds,   together  with
borrowings  currently  available to us, are  sufficient  to sustain our proposed
activities for the next 12 months following the offering.

institutions.

         On March 20, 2003, we completed a $25.0 million private placement of
trust preferred securities pursuant to Rule 144A of the Securities Act of 1933.
In conjunction with this private placement, we formed a new Connecticut business
trust subsidiary, First Bank Statutory Trust, or FBST. We own all of the common
securities of FBST. The cumulative trust preferred securities of FBST are
privately held, and FBST utilized the proceeds from the issuance of the common
and preferred securities to purchase approximately $25.8 million of fixed rate
subordinated debentures from us. The subordinated debentures mature on March 20,
2033. The subordinated debentures are the sole asset of FBST. In connection with
the issuance of the preferred securities, we made certain guarantees and
commitments that, in the aggregate, constitute a full and unconditional
guarantee by us on a subordinated basis of the obligations of FBST under FBST's
preferred securities. Distributions on the FBST preferred securities are payable
quarterly in arrears on March 31, June 30, September 30 and December 31,
beginning on March 31, 2003. The net proceeds from the sale of the trust
preferred securities were approximately $24.5 million after deduction of
offering expenses and private placement commissions.

         The revolving credit line initially provided a $90 million revolving
credit line and a $20 million letter of credit. On December 31, 2002, the
revolving credit line was amended, at the request of First Banks, to provide a
$45 million revolving credit line and a $20 million letter of credit.
Additionally, the revolving credit line was amended to reduce from 0.70% to
0.60% the minimum return on average assets ratio that First Banks is required to
meet for the year ended December 31, 2002 and to add a covenant providing that
for the quarter ending December 31, 2002 and each following quarter, First Banks
is required to maintain a minimum return on average assets ratio, computed with
respect to the current quarter annualized, of at least 0.80%. The revolving
credit line defines return on average assets as the percentage determined by
dividing First Banks' net income for the immediately preceding four calendar
quarters by total average assets as reflected on First Banks' balance sheet at
the end of the most recently completed calendar quarter. First Banks requested
this amendment because it anticipated that its minimum return on average assets
determined for the four quarters ended December 31, 2002 would be less than
0.70%. Interest is payable on outstanding principal loan balances at a floating
rate equal to, either the lender's prime rate or, at our option, the Eurodollar
rate plus a margin determined by the outstanding loan balances and our net
income for the preceding four calendar quarters. If the loan balances
outstanding under the revolving credit line are accruing at the prime rate,
interest is to be paid monthly. If the loan balances outstanding under the
revolving credit line are accruing at the London InterBank Offering Rate, or
LIBOR, interest is payable based on the one, two, three or six-month LIBOR rates
as selected by us. The revolving credit line matures on August 21, 2003 and is
secured by a pledge of the stock of our banking subsidiaries."

shares in this offering and after deducting expenses of the offering, expected 
to be $1,900,001 including underwriter discounts. If GunnAllen Financial, Inc. 
exercises its over-allotment option in full, we expect our net proceeds to be 
approximately $9,400,000 and intend to use the additional net proceeds for 
working capital. As there has been no public market for our common stock the 
initial public offering price of our common stock has been determined by 
negotiation between us and GunnAllen Financial, Inc.

     Approximately $3,980,000 of the proceeds of this offering will be used to 
repay amounts owed to persons who purchased debt securities from us. Of this 
amount, we will pay approximately $2,402,000 of principal, and interest, to 
purchasers of 10% promissory notes sold in a bridge financing which immediately 
preceded this offering. These promissory notes mature on the earlier of 
December 31, 2003 and completion of the offering. We used proceeds from the 
financing primarily for design and engineering fees. We also used proceeds to 
pay outstanding payables for parts, professional fees and commissions, and 
operating expenses including salaries and rent. We will also use the net 
proceeds of this offering to pay approximately $772,000 of principal and 
interest to purchasers of 15% promissory notes issued from September 2001 
through April 2002. The notes mature on the earlier of December 31, 2003 and 
completion of the offering, and may be converted during the five-day period 
following the offering into our common stock at the offering price. We used 
proceeds from the financing primarily to pay outstanding payables for parts, 
professional fees and commissions, as well as operating expenses including 
salaries and rent. We intend to use approximately $200,000 of the proceeds to 
pay the principal and interest on promissory notes issued to three lenders. 
These notes accrue interest at the rate of 10% and mature on the earlier of 
completion of the offering and June 30, 2003. We will pay approximately 
$367,000 to four vendors and service providers whose accounts payable were 
converted into notes payable. The notes mature on the earlier of completion of 
the offering and June 30, 2003, and interest on these notes ranges from 10% to 
18%. In addition, we intend to use the proceeds to repay approximately $88,000 
of credit card balances with interest rates ranging from 6% to 29.9% which are 
payable over time and approximately $136,000 of various lines of credit with 
interest rates ranging from 6.75% to 7.5% which are payable over time. 

      We expect to use approximately $550,000 of net proceeds to continue the 
design and engineering of our initial and future snowmobiles. We may use up to 
$100,000 of this amount to design and engineer an ATV. We expect to use 
approximately $700,000 for sales and marketing purposes, which will include 
recruiting, training and assisting dealers in marketing and promotional 
activities, participation at trade shows and general promotional efforts. We 
expect to use approximately $500,000 to purchase capital equipment for our 
production facility in Vista, California and for tooling for future products. 
We expect to use approximately $800,000 to purchase additional parts for the 
in-house production of the 800 Revolt. We intend to use approximately $995,000 
for general and administrative expenses consisting primarily of corporate 
salaries in the amount of $600,000, insurance in the amount of $100,000 and 
$295,000 for professional fees, utilities and other general expenses. We intend 
to use the balance of the net proceeds, as well as any proceeds from the exercise of 
GunnAllen Financial, Inc.’s over-allotment option, for working capital. Working 
capital includes labor for in-house production of snowmobiles, along with 
payments to a potential third party contract manufacturer. We intend to use 
approximately $42,330 of the proceeds allocated to working capital to pay 
amounts owed to two service providers. This amount does not accrue interest and 
matures on the earlier of completion of the offering and June 30, 2003. We will 
pay approximately $110,000 to two officers to reimburse them for expenses 
incurred on our behalf. No interest accrues on this amount, which is due upon 
demand. 

      The foregoing represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon the current status of our business. This 
estimate is based on certain assumptions, including the development of our 
business in the way we anticipate. If any of our assumptions prove incorrect, 
we may find it necessary to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the 
above-described categories or use portions of the proceeds for other purposes. 
Our estimates may prove to be inaccurate, new programs or activities may be 
undertaken which will require considerable additional expenditures or 
unforeseen expenses may occur. If actual sales of the 800 Revolt are less than 
we anticipate, we may increase sales and marketing expenditures to increase 
awareness of the 800 Revolt, or accelerate the introduction of the 800 Mountain 
Revolt, the Revolution or an ATV product. Accelerating the introduction of 
other products would require us to spend a greater portion of net proceeds on 
design and engineering, sales and marketing, capital expenditures and purchases 
of parts. Additionally, if we experience significant delays in engaging a 
contract manufacturer, we may increase capital expenditures to enhance our 
manufacturing capabilities at our facility in Vista, California. 

      Pending use, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in bank 
certificates of deposit and other fully insured investment grade interest 
bearing securities."

estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. 

      We currently intend to use the estimated net proceeds from this offering 
as follows: 

   
   •   $46.1 million for the repayment of outstanding subordinated promissory 
notes (which had a carrying value of $40.7 million as of December 31, 2002);  
   
   •   up to $5.0 million for working capital; and

potential acquisitions of businesses and merchant portfolios that are 
complementary to our own. Currently, we have no specific plans or commitments 
with respect to any acquisition. We cannot assure you that we will complete any 
acquisitions or that, if completed, any acquisition will be successful.

principal amount of $78.1 million (net of discount of $6.4 million), owed to 
various individuals and entities, with interest rates ranging from 0% to 14% as

     Of these notes, $43.4 million were issued within a year of the date of this 
prospectus. In each case, we used the proceeds to fund acquisitions of 
businesses and portfolios of merchant accounts, as well as to fund working 
capital. In addition, $11.4 million of the notes to be repaid are held by 
affiliates and related parties.

be approximately $71.4 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering costs. If the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $83.1 million. The selling stockholders will receive aggregate 
net proceeds of approximately $5.1 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions. The selling stockholders intend to use net proceeds 
to them from the sale of shares of common stock to repay the outstanding 
principal of and unpaid accrued interest on loans from us and to pay the 
related tax liability. The selling stockholders will retain any additional 
proceeds realized from the sale of their shares. As a result, we will receive 
approximately $2.7 million of the aggregate net proceeds from the sale of 
common stock by the selling stockholders. 

      The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
establish a public market for our common stock and facilitate our future access 
to public capital markets. We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this 
offering for general corporate purposes and working capital requirements. We
may use a portion of the net proceeds to us for leasehold improvements at our 
new corporate headquarters and manufacturing facility, which improvements we 
expect will total approximately $25.0 million through the third quarter of 2004. 
We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to us to fund possible 
investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or 
technologies or establishing joint ventures. We have no current agreements or 
commitments with respect to any investment, acquisition or joint venture, and 
we currently are not engaged in negotiations with respect to any investment, 
acquisition or joint venture. Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds to us from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, 
investment grade securities. 

      The amount and timing of what we actually spend for these purposes may 
vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future 
revenue and cash generated by operations and the other factors described in
