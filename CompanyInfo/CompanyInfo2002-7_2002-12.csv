of Class A common stock in this offering will be approximately $99.0 million
($115.3 million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in
full), at an initial public offering price of $13.00 per share and after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses
payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our
Class A common stock by the selling stockholders.
 
     We currently expect to use our net proceeds of this offering as follows:
 
     - to repay the entire balance outstanding under our revolving credit
       facility, which balance is currently expected to be approximately $35
       million upon the completion of this offering; and
 
     - for working capital, including for a portion of an estimated $100 million
       for seasonal increases in accounts receivable and inventory, and for
       other general corporate purposes.
 
     Although we have estimated some of our uses of the net proceeds above, our
actual use of the net proceeds may vary from these estimates. We will have
significant discretion in the use of the net proceeds of this offering and you
will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of
the proceeds. Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest these
funds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade obligations.
 
     Our revolving credit facility expires on July 10, 2004, and the advances
under this facility bear interest at a variable rate, which at March 31, 2002
was 5.0%. After July 10, 2002, our credit facility provides for a waiver of
prepayment penalties if we repay the facility from the proceeds of an initial
public offering. Proceeds from indebtedness incurred over the past year under
our credit facility were primarily used to fund seasonal increases in accounts
receivable and inventory."

commissions and estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with borrowings 
under our new revolving credit facility described below, as follows: 
  
   Ÿ     approximately $47.7 million to repay the outstanding amounts under our 
term loan with Finova Capital Corporation, including a prepayment penalty of 
4.0%, which bears interest at 9.9% and has a maturity date of September 1, 2012.  

  
   Ÿ     approximately $5.0 million to repay the outstanding amounts under our 
revolving credit facility with U.S. Bank National Association, which bears 
interest at the London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.0% and has a 
maturity date of March 31, 2003. We entered into this revolving credit facility 
for working capital and capital expenditure needs.  

  
   Ÿ     approximately $1.6 million to repay the outstanding amounts under one 
real estate loan with Captec Financial Group, including a prepayment penalty of 
1.0%, which bears interest at 10.1% and has a maturity date of January 1, 2012.  

  
   Ÿ     approximately $0.4 million to repay the outstanding amounts under two 
equipment loans with Captec and one equipment loan with General Electric 
Capital Corporation, which bear interest at rates ranging from 9.6% to 11.6% 
and have maturity dates between April 1, 2003 and December 1, 2003.  

  
We have entered into commitment letters with Wachovia Bank, N.A. and other 
lenders to enter into a new revolving credit facility of up to $40.0 million, 
which we expect to close at or shortly after the consummation of this offering. 
Upon the closing of this facility, we intend to borrow $11.3 million under this 
revolving credit facility to fund in part the transactions listed above. In 
addition, from time to time, we intend to borrow under this revolving credit 
facility for general corporate purposes, including opening new restaurants and 
the acquisition of existing restaurants from franchisees. We regularly consider 
acquisitions of existing restaurants from our franchisees in the ordinary 
course of business, although we currently have no agreements regarding any 
future acquisitions."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We will 
not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock by the selling 
stockholder in connection with the exercise of the over-allotment option. 

We currently plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

• approximately $10.0 million to expand our corporate infrastructure and 
customer support capabilities; 


• approximately $10.0 million to continue our research and development of new 
and existing products; 


• approximately $1.75 million as partial payment to Dr. James Mault, our 
chairman and chief executive officer, for the assignment of patent rights, as 
more fully described in ""Certain Transactions""; and 


• the remainder for general corporate purposes and working capital needs. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to make strategic 
acquisitions of other companies, technology or products that complement our 
business or to enter into strategic relationships with other parties. However, 
we currently have no commitments or agreements and are not involved in any 
negotiations with respect to any such transactions. The amounts actually 
expended for these purposes may vary significantly and will depend upon a number 
of factors, including the amount of our future revenues and expenses and other 
factors described under ""Risk Factors."" Pending use of the net proceeds of this 
offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds generally in short-term, 
interest-bearing securities. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to raise capital and increase our 
financial flexibility, to provide a public market for our common stock and to 
facilitate access to public equity markets. As of the date of this prospectus, 
we cannot specify with certainty, other than with respect to the acquisition of 
the patent rights from Dr. Mault, all of the particular uses for the net 
proceeds we will have upon completion of this offering or the specific amounts 
that may be allocated to those uses. Our management will have significant 
discretion and flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering."

of common stock offered by us will be approximately $67.0 million, after

       We expect to use the net proceeds to us from this offering as follows:
 
       - $20.1 million to repay all of our outstanding subordinated debt,
         including accrued and unpaid interest;
 
       - $11.9 million to redeem $9.2 million of aggregate stated value of
         mandatorily redeemable Class C Preferred Stock and $2.7 million of

         Preferred Stock and Class D Preferred Stock and 589,798 shares of
         common stock ($13.7 million of these proceeds will be paid to our
         affiliates); and
 
       - $1.0 million for working capital and general corporate purposes.
 
       Our subordinated debt consists of $20.0 million subordinated notes
bearing interest at 12.5% per year and maturing on June 30, 2003. By their
terms, the subordinated notes are required to be repaid in full with the
proceeds of this offering.
 
       We issued our Class C Preferred Stock to affiliates in connection with
our 1996 recapitalization and the Class C Preferred Stock has an aggregate
stated value of $17.1 million at May 4, 2002. See ""Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations"" and ""Related Party
Transactions - Recapitalization."" We accrue an annual amount equal to 9% of the
outstanding stated value of the Class C Preferred Stock, which has been
reflected as interest expense in our consolidated financial statements. As of
May 4, 2002, the aggregate unpaid accrual with respect to the Class C Preferred
Stock amounted to $7.7 million. A portion of the proceeds from our new credit
facility was used to repay $5.7 million of the aggregate unpaid accrual with
respect to the Class C Preferred Stock. The Class C Preferred Stock is required
to be redeemed with the proceeds of this offering. Of the outstanding shares of
Class C Preferred Stock, a total 258,425 shares are not being redeemed but are
being exchanged for 567,526 shares of common stock. These shares of common stock
are being sold in this offering.
 
       We issued our Class A Preferred Stock, Class B Preferred Stock and Class
D Preferred Stock in connection with various financings between 1996 and 2000.
At May 4, 2002, the outstanding Class A, B and D Preferred Stock had an
aggregate liquidation value of $89.4 million, including $28.0 million of accrued
dividends. The Class A, B and D Preferred Stock currently accrue cumulative
dividends at a rate of 10% per year compounded quarterly. All outstanding shares
of Class A, B and D Preferred Stock that are not being redeemed with proceeds of
this offering will be converted into common stock immediately prior to the
completion of this offering."

ordinary shares in the form of ADSs, offered hereby will be approximately 
$29.1 million, based upon a public offering price of $6.50 per ordinary share, 
or $13.00 per ADS, after deducting underwriting discounts and the estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise any part of their 
over-allotment option, they will purchase the additional ordinary shares from 
the selling shareholder. We will not share in any of the net proceeds relating 
to the sale of ordinary shares for the account of the selling shareholder. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay at least $7.0 
million under our syndicated term loan and credit facility with a consortium of 
financial lenders led by NM Rothschild & Sons Limited, approximately $15 million 
for completing feasibility studies and financing development activities and the 
balance, if any, to fund working capital requirements. 

Under our syndicated term loan and credit facility, if we issue any share 
capital, we must make a mandatory repayment in a principal amount equal to the 
lesser of: 

o the greater of 25% of the dollar value of the proceeds of the issuance and 
$7.0 million; and 

o the proceeds of the issuance. 

On March 31, 2002, borrowings outstanding under the syndicated term loan were 
$24.25 million. In addition, we had $8 million drawn down on our credit 
facility. As of January 31, 2002, we have begun making quarterly repayments 
against the outstanding balance of the syndicated term loan and it is due to be 
repaid in full on September 17, 2005. The interest rate on the syndicated term 
loan is LIBOR plus 3.75% per annum, and the interest rate on the credit facility 
is LIBOR plus 4.25% per annum. We used $30 million of the proceeds of the 
syndicated term loan and credit facility to finance a portion of our 2001 
mandatory share repurchase program. 

Pending the above uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds from this offering 
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

cannot be determined until the conversion is completed, we presently anticipate 
that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock will be 
between $14.0 million and $19.3 million and up to $22.3 million assuming an 
increase in the estimated value of the common stock sold in the conversion by 
15%. Offering expenses of approximately $860,000 have been subtracted from 
gross proceeds to determine net proceeds. 

       We intend to use the net proceeds received from the stock offering, 
assuming completion of the offering at the minimum, maximum and maximum as 
adjusted of the estimated offering range, as set forth below. The percentages 
are based on the gross proceeds received from the stock offering.

       Monarch Community Bancorp will retain 50% of the net conversion proceeds, 
from which it will fund the loan to be made to the employee stock ownership 
plan, and will purchase all of the capital stock of Branch County to be issued 
in the conversion in exchange for the remaining conversion proceeds. Monarch 
Community Bancorp intends to use a portion of the net proceeds to make a loan 
directly to the employee stock ownership plan to enable the employee stock 
ownership plan to purchase up to 8.0% of the shares of common stock issued in 
the conversion. Based upon the issuance of 1,487,500 shares of common stock and 
2,012,500 shares of common stock at the minimum and maximum of the estimated 
offering range, respectively, the loan to the employee stock ownership plan 
would be $1.2 million and $1.6 million, respectively. The 
remaining net proceeds retained by Monarch Community Bancorp initially may be 
used to invest in overnight funds at the Federal Home Loan Bank, U.S. Government 
and federal agency securities of various maturities, mortgage-backed or other 
securities, deposits in either Branch County or other financial institutions, 
or a combination thereof. The net proceeds may ultimately be used to: 

 •  support Branch County's lending activities;  


 
 •  repay borrowings in the ordinary course of business; or  

 
 •  support the future expansion of operations through the establishment of 
additional banking offices or other customer facilities or through acquisitions 
of other financial institutions or branch offices, although no such acquisition 
transactions are specifically being considered at this time.  

The net proceeds from the conversion may also be used for other business and 
investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special cash dividends 
or possible repurchases of the common stock. Monarch Community Bancorp and 
Branch County have committed however, not to take any action to further the 
payment of any return of capital on the common stock during the one-year period 
subsequent to completion of the conversion. Management of Monarch Community 
Bancorp may consider expanding or diversifying its activities, as such 
opportunities become available. 

       Following the one year anniversary of the completion of the conversion 
based upon then existing facts and circumstances, Monarch Community Bancorp's 
board of directors may determine to repurchase shares of common stock, subject 
to any applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. Such facts and 
circumstances may include but not be limited to: 

 •  market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in Monarch Community Bancorp's 
return on equity;  


 
 •  the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and  

 
 •  any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of Monarch Community Bancorp and its stockholders.  

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of Monarch Community 
Bancorp's board of directors that Branch County will be capitalized in excess 
of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. 

       The portion of the net proceeds used by Monarch Community Bancorp to 
purchase the capital stock of Branch County will be added to Branch County's 
general funds to be used for 
general corporate purposes, including increased lending activities. While the 
amount of net proceeds received by Branch County will further strengthen Branch 
County's capital position, which already substantially exceeds all regulatory 
requirements, Branch County is not converting to stock form primarily to raise 
capital. After the conversion, based upon the maximum of the estimated offering 
range, Branch County's tangible capital ratio will be approximately 12.63%. As 
a result, Branch County will continue to be a well-capitalized institution. The 
board of directors has broad discretion in determining the ultimate use of the 
proceeds. 

       The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may 
be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the 
number of shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change 
in the estimated pro forma market value of Branch County. Payments for shares 
made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Branch County will 
not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by Branch County but will 
result in a reduction of Branch County's interest expense and liabilities as 
funds are transferred from interest-bearing certificates or other deposit 
accounts."

cannot be determined until the conversion is completed, we presently anticipate 
that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock will be 
between $32.8 million and $44.6 million and up to $51.5 million assuming an 
increase in the estimated value of the common stock sold in the conversion by 
15%. See ""Pro Forma Data"" and ""Pacific Trust Bank's Conversion - How We 
Determined Our Price and the Number of Shares to be Issued in the Stock 
Offering"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at such amounts. 

      We intend to use the net proceeds received from the stock offering as 
follows:

      First PacTrust Bancorp, Inc. will retain 50% of the net conversion 
proceeds from which the loan to be made to the ^401(k) Employee Stock Ownership 
Plan will be made, and will purchase all of the capital stock of Pacific Trust 
Bank to be issued in the conversion in exchange for the remaining conversion 
proceeds. First PacTrust Bancorp, Inc. intends to use a portion of the net 
proceeds to make a loan directly to the ^401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan 
to enable the 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan to purchase up to 8.0% of 
the shares of common stock issued in the conversion. Based upon the issuance of 
3,400,000 shares of common stock and 4,600,000 shares of common stock at the 
minimum and maximum of the estimated offering range, respectively, the loan to 
the 401(k) Employee Stock Ownership Plan would be $2.7 million and 
$3.7 million, respectively. See ""Management - Benefits - 401(k) Employee Stock 
Ownership Plan."" The remaining net proceeds retained by First PacTrust Bancorp, 
Inc. initially may be used to invest in U.S. Government and federal agency 
securities of various maturities, mortgage-backed or other securities, deposits 
in either Pacific Trust Bank or other financial institutions, or a combination 
thereof. The net proceeds may ultimately be used to: 

support Pacific Trust Bank's lending activities; 

repay borrowings in the ordinary course of business; or 


support the future expansion of operations through the establishment of 
additional banking offices or other customer facilities or through acquisitions 
of other financial institutions or branch offices, although no such acquisition 
transactions are specifically being considered at this time. 

The net proceeds from the conversion may also be used for other business and 
investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special cash dividends, 
possible repurchases of the common stock or returns of capital. First PacTrust 
Bancorp, Inc. and Pacific Trust Bank have committed however, not to take any 
action to further the payment of any return of capital on the common stock 
during the one-year period subsequent to completion of the conversion. 
Management of First PacTrust Bancorp, Inc. may consider expanding or 
diversifying its activities, as such opportunities become available. 

      Following the completion of the conversion, to the extent permitted by 
the Office of Thrift Supervision and based upon then existing facts and 
circumstances, First PacTrust Bancorp, Inc.'s board of directors may determine 
to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any applicable statutory and 
regulatory requirements. Such facts and circumstances may include but not be 
limited to: 

market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading in 
the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, 
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in First PacTrust Bancorp, 
Inc.'s return on equity; 


the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue additional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit 
plans; and 


any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests of 
First PacTrust Bancorp, Inc. and its stockholders. 

Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of First PacTrust 
Bancorp, Inc.'s board of directors that Pacific Trust Bank will be capitalized 
in excess of all applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases. 

      The portion of the net proceeds used by First PacTrust Bancorp, Inc. to

Bank's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes, including 
increased lending activities. While the amount of net proceeds received by 
Pacific Trust Bank will further strengthen Pacific Trust Bank's capital 
position, which already substantially exceeds all regulatory requirements, 
Pacific Trust Bank is not converting to stock form primarily to raise capital. 
After the conversion, based upon the maximum of the estimated offering range, 
Pacific Trust Bank's tangible capital ratio will be approximately 14.2%. As a 
result, Pacific Trust Bank will continue to be a well-capitalized institution. 

      The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may be 
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the

preferred securities which are stated to mature on June 30, 2027, NPB Capital
Trust will use the proceeds from the redemption of our 9% junior subordinated
debentures to redeem its 9% trust preferred securities. We expect to use the
remainder of the net proceeds from the sale of the debentures for general
corporate purposes, including capital contributions to our banking subsidiaries
to support their growth strategies, for working capital and for repurchases of
our common stock. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to fund future
acquisitions, although we do not presently have any understandings with respect
to any such future acquisitions. We may also use the net proceeds to make
investments in shorter-term marketable securities."

seven initial properties that we currently have under contract to purchase

short-term investment grade securities or money market accounts, which are 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT. Such investments may 
include, for example, government and government agency securities, certificates

A portion of the net proceeds of the Public Offering, the Cash Contribution and 
the RenaissanceRe Investment, currently estimated at approximately $10 million, 
will be retained by Platinum Holdings and the balance will be contributed to the 
capital of Platinum US (in an amount not less than $250 million, which includes 
net proceeds from the ESU Offering as discussed below), Platinum UK (in an 
amount not less than $150 million, upon its being licensed in the United 
Kingdom), Platinum Ireland (in an amount not less than $100 million, 
substantially all of which will be used to purchase a surplus note issued by 
Platinum US) and Platinum Bermuda (in an amount not less than $375 million). To 
the extent we receive net proceeds from the Public Offering, the Cash 
Contribution and the RenaissanceRe Investment in excess of the minimum amounts 
stated above, we expect to contribute substantially all such proceeds to the 
capital of Platinum Bermuda. All but approximately $20 million of the net 
proceeds from the ESU Offering (or approximately $23 million if the underwriters 
exercise in full their option to purchase additional equity security units) will 
be contributed to Platinum US. The remaining net proceeds from the ESU Offering 
will be retained by Platinum Finance. 

The allocation of net proceeds among our three operating subsidiaries (Platinum 
US, Platinum UK and Platinum Bermuda) and Platinum Ireland has been determined 
based on: our assessment of the level of capital that is prudent to support 
their expected levels of reinsurance business; applicable regulatory 
requirements; discussions with insurance regulatory authorities and rating 
agencies; and capital efficiency considerations. The amount of net proceeds to 
be retained by Platinum Finance will be sufficient for it to pay three years of 
interest on the senior notes that it will issue in the ESU Offering while the 
net proceeds to be retained by Platinum Holdings is the amount that we believe 
to be appropriate given its expected initial cash needs. 

The following table shows the application of the minimum and maximum aggregate 
estimated net proceeds of the Public Offering, the Cash Contribution, the 
RenaissanceRe Investment and the ESU Offering. The minimum net proceeds assume 
no exercise of the underwriters', St. Paul's or RenaissanceRe's options to 
purchase additional Common Shares in connection with the Public Offering or the 
underwriters' option to purchase additional equity security units (i.e., 
aggregate net proceeds of $966 million) and the maximum net proceeds assume 
full exercise of the underwriters', St. Paul's and RenaissanceRe's options to

underwriters' option to purchase additional equity security units (i.e., 
aggregate net proceeds of $1,112 million):

of shares of our common stock in this offering based on the sale of 34,615,000 
shares at an initial public offering price of $13.00 per share after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. Of these 
net proceeds, approximately $255.7 million would be received from the sale of 
shares sold by the underwriters and $171 million in net proceeds would be 
received from the sale of shares made directly by us to certain purchasers, 
including Mr. Wynn and Aruze USA. If the underwriters exercise their over-
allotment option in full, we expect our net proceeds to be approximately $465.6 
million. 
Concurrent with the consummation of this offering: 

(1) Our wholly owned subsidiaries, Wynn Las Vegas and Wynn Capital, will jointly 
consummate an offering of second mortgage notes. We expect Wynn Las Vegas to 
receive approximately $329.4 million in net proceeds from the second mortgage 
note offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses; and 

(2) Wynn Las Vegas will enter into a $750.0 million revolving credit facility, 
a $250.0 million delay draw term loan facility and a $188.5 million FF&E 
facility. Wynn Las Vegas has received commitments for the credit facility and 
the delay draw term loan facility, and the placement agent for the FF&E facility 
has received commitments from the lenders who will enter into the FF&E facility. 
We intend to contribute to Wynn Las Vegas approximately $386.7 million of the 
net proceeds from this offering and all of the existing cash on hand held by 
Valvino. Wynn Las Vegas intends to use those contributions together with the 
net proceeds from the second mortgage notes offering and borrowings under the 
revolving credit facility, delay draw term loan facility and FF&E facility to 
design, develop, construct, equip and open Le Rêve. 

In addition, we intend to use up to $40 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering as part of the financing of Wynn Macau to design, construct, develop, 
equip and operate one or more casino resorts in Macau. 

        Wynn Las Vegas will enter into a disbursement agreement with the agents 
under the credit facilities and the FF&E facility and the second mortgage note 
trustee which will require that Le Rêve project costs be funded first from 
contributions we will have made to Wynn Las Vegas, then from the net proceeds 
of the second mortgage notes offering and then from the other debt facilities. 
We expect Wynn Las Vegas to begin to request disbursements of the second 
mortgage note proceeds, subject to satisfaction of the conditions in the 
disbursement agreement, approximately ten to twelve months after the 
consummation of this offering and after expending all of the net proceeds of 
this offering contributed to it, other than the funds securing the completion 
guarantee and the funds to be deposited in the liquidity reserve account. 

        We expect that the funds provided by these sources and available cash 
will be sufficient to design, develop, construct, equip and open Le Rêve and to 
pay interest on borrowings under the credit facilities, the FF&E facility and 
the second mortgage notes until the scheduled opening of Le Rêve, assuming there 
are no significant delay costs or construction cost overruns for which we are 
responsible. We believe that the construction budget for Le Rêve is reasonable, 
but given the risks inherent in the construction process, it is possible that 
the costs of developing and constructing Le Rêve could be significantly higher. 

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in this offering, we 
may use the additional net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
for unanticipated construction and debt service expenses relating to Le Rêve and 
for additional expenditures related to the Macau opportunity. We may, but are 
not obligated to, contribute these funds to Wynn Las Vegas. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term highly rated securities. 

Of the $386.7 million in net proceeds from this offering that Wynn Resorts will 
contribute to Wynn Las Vegas, $50 million will be contributed to a special 
purpose subsidiary of Wynn Las Vegas which will be providing a $50 million 
completion guarantee in favor of the lenders under the credit facilities and 
the holders of the second mortgage notes to support that subsidiary's 
obligations under the completion guarantee. These funds will be deposited into 
a collateral account to be held in cash or short-term highly rated securities, 
and pledged to the senior lenders under the credit facilities and the holders of 
the second mortgage notes as security for the completion guarantee. Pursuant to 
the disbursement agreement that will govern the disbursement of funds from our 
debt facilities to fund Le Rêve project costs, these funds will become available 
to Wynn Las Vegas on a gradual basis to apply to the costs of the project only 
after fifty percent of the Le Rêve construction work has been completed. After 
the completion and opening of Le Rêve, any amounts remaining in this account 
will be released to Wynn Resorts. 

In addition, of the $386.7 million in net proceeds from this offering that Wynn 
Resorts will contribute to Wynn Las Vegas, $30 million will be held in a 
liquidity reserve account and pledged to the lenders under the credit facilities 
and the second mortgage note holders to secure Wynn Las Vegas' obligation to 
develop and construct Le Rêve. Until the opening of Le Rêve, these funds may be 
applied to the costs of the project in accordance with the disbursement 
agreement. Following the completion and opening of Le Rêve, these funds will be 
available to meet Wynn Las Vegas' debt service needs in connection with Le Rêve. 
Once Wynn Las Vegas has met prescribed cash flow tests for a period of four 
consecutive fiscal quarters after the completion and opening of Le Rêve, any 
remaining funds will be used to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving 
credit facility, but without reducing the revolving credit facility commitment. 

Approximately $306.7 million of the $386.7 million in net proceeds from this 
offering that Wynn Resorts will contribute to Wynn Las Vegas will be used, along 
with the cash on hand that Valvino will contribute to Wynn Las Vegas, to fund 
the development and construction of Le Rêve, including pre-opening and debt 
service payments. We expect that these net proceeds will be used to fund the 
initial phases of construction of Le Rêve, including contractor monthly payment 
applications, design fees and operational payroll. 

The following table sets forth estimated sources and uses of funds to design, 
develop, construct, equip and open Le Rêve and for other operations related 
primarily to the Le Rêve project and includes certain amounts invested and 
reserved for investment in connection with the financing of the design, 
construction, development, equipping and operation of one or more casinos in 
Macau; however, substantial additional financing will be required for the Macau 
opportunity. The table includes all sources and uses of funds since the 
inception of Wynn Resorts and our subsidiaries. The table assumes that the 
financing transactions, including this offering, closed on October 1, 2002. For 
purposes of calculating total construction costs, the revolving credit facility 
balance and interest and commitment fees, this 
table also includes certain final construction cost payments that we assume will 
be made after the opening of Le Rêve.

 (1) Wynn Las Vegas will issue $370 million aggregate principal amount of 12% 
second mortgage notes, offered at a price of 92.793%, with an effective yield 
to maturity of 13.50%. 

(2) Includes (a) Valvino member net contributions of approximately $586.1 
million and (b) the anticipated gross proceeds from this offering of 
approximately $450 million. 

(3) Represents interest earned at the estimated LIBOR rate on our estimated cash 
balance through the scheduled opening of Le Rêve. Estimates of the LIBOR rate 
are based on current market projections of the LIBOR rate ranging from 
approximately 2% to 4%. Interest income shown has not been adjusted for taxes 
that will be payable on those amounts. Depending on the extent to which our 
expenses must be capitalized into the construction project rather than deducted 
currently, we may owe corporate income tax on our interest income. 

(4) Consists of net income from incidental operations, including our brief 
operation of the Desert Inn Resort & Casino by Valvino before the casino was 
closed, operation of the golf course on the site of the former Desert Inn 
Resort & Casino through June 30, 2002 and the collection of accounts receivable 
following the acquisition of the previous facility at the site. 

(5) Represents the owner's contingency with respect to the portions of the Le 
Rêve project not covered by the construction contract. This amount does not 
include the owner's contingency of approximately $7.6 million under the 
construction contract. 

(6) Represents amounts previously expended to acquire land for the Le Rêve 
project, including the golf course land, buildings and water rights. 

(7) Consists primarily of operating costs of the previous facility at the Le 
Rêve site before closure of that facility and facility closure expenditures. 

(8) Represents (a) a purchase price of approximately $38.2 million for the 
corporate aircraft, of which approximately $9.7 million was paid in cash at the 
time of purchase and $28.5 million was represented by a loan from Bank of 
America, N.A to World Travel, which Valvino acquired from Mr. Wynn, and (b) 
approximately $0.5 million in interest payments on the Bank of America loan 
anticipated to be made prior to the closing of this offering. Borrowings under 
the FF&E facility, but not proceeds from this offering, will be used to repay 
the outstanding balance of this loan. 

(9) Includes interest expense on the second mortgage notes, and expected 
interest expense and commitment fees on the revolving credit facility, the 
delay draw term loan facility and the FF&E facility through the scheduled 
opening date of Le Rêve. Interest on the revolving credit facility, the delay 
draw term loan facility and the FF&E facility has been computed assuming a 
LIBOR rate ranging from approximately 2% to 4%, plus the applicable margin, 
which is a 4% margin for the revolving credit facility and the FF&E facility 
and a 5.50% margin for the delay draw term loan facility. 

(10) Represents expenditures and commitments in connection with negotiation of 
the Macau concession agreement, including Wynn Macau's share of a capital 
contribution required by Macau law. Does not include amounts necessary to 
finance the design, construction, development, equipping and operation of 
casino(s) in Macau. 

(11) We intend to invest up to $40 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering in Wynn Macau as part of the financing of the Macau opportunity. 

(12) Includes fees and expenses related to (a) this offering, (b) the second 
mortgage note offering and (c) the revolving credit facility, the delay draw 
term loan facility and the FF&E facility."

proceeds we will receive from the sale of shares of common stock until the
offering is completed, we anticipate that the net proceeds will be between $10.2

      The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the
conversion and offering may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our
expenses would increase if a syndicated community offering were used to sell
shares of common stock not purchased in the subscription offering and any
community offering. Payments for shares made through withdrawals from existing
deposit accounts will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment but
will result in a reduction of Atlantic Liberty Savings, F.A.'s deposits. In all
instances, Atlantic Liberty Savings, F.A. will receive 50% of the net proceeds
of the offering.

      We are undertaking the conversion and offering at this time in order to
have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our business. For
further information, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
Condition and Results of Operations - Business Strategy."" The offering proceeds
will increase our capital resources and the amount of funds available to us for
lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will also give us greater
flexibility to diversify operations and expand the products and services we
offer to our customers.

ATLANTIC LIBERTY FINANCIAL CORP. MAY USE THE PROCEEDS IT RETAINS FROM THE
OFFERING:

           to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and 
           other financial services businesses, although no specific 
           transactions are being considered at this time;

           to invest in securities;

           to repurchase its shares of common stock;

           to pay dividends to our stockholders; and

           for general corporate purposes.

      Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not
repurchase shares of our common stock during the first year following the
conversion and offering, except when extraordinary circumstances exist and with
prior regulatory approval.

ATLANTIC LIBERTY SAVINGS, F.A. MAY USE THE PROCEEDS IT RECEIVES FROM THE
OFFERING:

           to fund new loans, including one-to four-family mortgage loans, 
           multi-family real estate loans and commercial real estate loans;

           to expand its retail banking franchise, by establishing or acquiring 
           new branches or by acquiring other financial institutions, or other 
           financial services companies, although no transactions are 
           specifically being considered at this time;

           to support new products and services;

           to invest in securities; and

           for general corporate purposes.

                The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on 
           changes in interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations 
           affecting the financial services industry, our relative position in 
           the financial services industry, the attractiveness of potential 
           acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall market conditions."

approximately $90.9 million. 
  
We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness 
under our existing credit facility. The indebtedness under our existing credit 
facility bears interest at a weighted average rate equal to 6.4% as of June 30, 
2002, and has a final maturity of September 17, 2004. We used the indebtedness

approximately $33.6 million. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option, our net proceeds will be approximately $38.7 million. Net proceeds are 
what we expect to receive after paying the underwriters’ discount and other 
expenses of the offering. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
shares of our common stock by the selling stockholder. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering of our common stock to 
satisfy a portion of our obligations under the settlement agreements described 
more fully in the section of this prospectus captioned “Litigation and 
Settlement.” Our obligation under the settlement agreements will be $61.9 
million. The remainder of our obligations under the settlement agreements will 
be satisfied by our proceeds from the concurrent offering of trust preferred 
securities. Our net proceeds from the concurrent offering of trust preferred 
securities will be approximately $42.0 million. For a detailed description of 
the terms of the settlement agreements, see the section of this prospectus 
captioned “Litigation and Settlement.” 

We intend to use the remaining aggregate net proceeds from this offering and the 
concurrent offering of trust preferred securities to reduce our outstanding term 
loan. We estimate that the remaining net proceeds from the offerings available 
to reduce our outstanding term loan and revolving line of credit will be $13.7 
million. As of June 30, 2002, we had approximately $27.2 million of outstanding 
indebtedness at the holding company level, consisting of a $23.0 million term 
loan and $4.2 million outstanding under our $12 million revolving line of 
credit. Our term loan bears interest, at our option, at either the lender’s 
prime rate or the London Interbank Offering Rate, or LIBOR, plus 1.15% with a 
minimum interest rate of 3.50%. The interest rate was 3.50% at June 30, 2002. 
The term loan is currently scheduled to mature on April 30, 2003. 

We have also received a commitment letter from our lender for a $10.0 million 
subordinated term loan. We will use the proceeds of this subordinated loan to 
repay in full any remaining amounts outstanding under our existing term loan. 
Upon completion of the concurrent offerings of common stock and trust preferred 
securities and the application of the net proceeds from these offerings as 
described above, and assuming the replacement of the current $23.0 million term 
loan with a $10.0 million subordinated term loan, our total indebtedness at the 
holding company level will be approximately $58.5 million. This will consist of 
the $45.0 million of debentures issued to TAYC Capital Trust I in connection 
with the concurrent offering of trust preferred securities, the $10.0 million 
subordinated term loan and $3.5 million outstanding under the $12.0 million 
revolving line of credit. The subordinated term loan will require that we make 
interest only payments until 2009 with a balloon payment at maturity. We believe 
that these transactions will result in our being considered “well capitalized” 
at the holding company level under Federal Reserve guidelines. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of the concurrent 
offerings of common stock and trust preferred securities in short-term, 
interest-bearing investment grade securities, certificates of deposit or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States of America."

minimum interest rate of 3.50%. The interest rate was 3.50% at June 30, 2002. 
The term loan is currently scheduled to mature on April 30, 2003. 

We have also received a commitment letter from our lender for a $10.0 million 
subordinated term loan. We will use the proceeds of this subordinated loan to 
repay in full any remaining amounts outstanding under our existing term loan. 
Upon completion of the concurrent offerings of common stock and trust preferred 
securities and the application of the net proceeds from these offerings as 
described above, and assuming the replacement of the current $23.0 million term 
loan with a $10.0 million subordinated term loan, our total indebtedness at the 
holding company level will be approximately $58.5 million. This will consist of 
the $45.0 million of debentures issued to TAYC Capital Trust I in connection 
with the concurrent offering of trust preferred securities, the $10.0 million 
subordinated term loan and $3.5 million outstanding under the $12.0 million 
revolving line of credit. The subordinated term loan will require that we make 
interest only payments until 2009 with a balloon payment at maturity. We believe 
that these transactions will result in our being considered “well capitalized” 
at the holding company level under Federal Reserve guidelines. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds of the concurrent 
offerings of common stock and trust preferred securities in short-term, 
interest-bearing investment grade securities, certificates of deposit or 
guaranteed obligations of the United States of America."

offered by us, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses, are estimated to be approximately $27.9 million. 
We will not receive any proceeds from shares of common stock sold by the selling 
stockholders, nor can we participate in the sale of additional shares relating 
to the underwriters’ overallotment option, if exercised. 

The principal purpose of this offering is to create a public market for our 
common stock in order to facilitate our future access to public capital. Under 
our current credit agreement, we are required to use the net proceeds from this 
offering to reduce the amount of indebtedness outstanding under our revolving 
bank facility including accrued interest. We intend, subject to compliance with 
the terms of our credit facility, to reborrow under the credit facility in the 
ordinary course of business and to use those reborrowings for opening new retail 
stores and general corporate purposes, including working capital. Our bank debt 
consists of a $180 million revolving credit facility in principal amount. At 
August 3, 2002, the outstanding balance under our credit facility was $90.3 
million (and was $125.1 million as of October 10, 2002). Borrowings under the 
credit facility bear interest at variable rates, and the weighted average 
interest rate at August 3, 2002 was 3.19% (and 3.06% as of October 10, 2002). 
The credit facility expires on May 30, 2006. In September 2001, we used 
borrowings under our revolving credit facility to repay promissory notes in the 
aggregate principal amount of $13.8 million in connection with our repurchase of 
shares of common stock from certain of our former preferred stockholders. 

In the event that we received proceeds in excess of our outstanding bank 
borrowings, pending the described uses of the net proceeds, we intend to invest 
that excess net proceeds in short-term investment grade securities."

all of the net proceeds of this offering to Montpelier Re, to increase its

underwritten by Montpelier Re will remain broadly consistent with those
underwritten in the first six months of 2002."

after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses.
 
     We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to pay a portion of the
$239.7 million purchase price for a portfolio of $235 million principal amount
of mortgage loans. We intend to initially finance approximately $158.3 million
of the purchase price for such mortgage loans. The mortgage loans and related
financing are to be obtained from affiliates of Bear Stearns. The financing will
be secured by the mortgage loans and will bear interest at LIBOR plus 0.75%. The
financing will permit us to further borrow up to an additional $57.4 million
(which amount, when added to $158.3 million, will not exceed 90% of the purchase
price of the mortgage loans). We intend to utilize borrowings under the
additional financing to purchase additional real estate securities, including
collateral for the CBO III transaction, and for general corporate purposes."

approximately $75 million of the proceeds to redeem its outstanding 8.25%

repay current outstanding bank indebtedness. As of June 30, 2002, the weighted 
average interest rate on such indebtedness was 2.34%. This indebtedness is 
under a revolving credit facility which is scheduled to terminate in October of 
2005. The proceeds remaining after repayment of such indebtedness will be used

portion of the cash proceeds it receives for general corporate purposes. The net
proceeds received by TierOne Bank will further strengthen our capital position,
which already exceeds all regulatory requirements, and will provide us with
additional flexibility to grow and diversify. The proceeds invested in TierOne
Bank, in addition to funding new loans and being invested in equity
securities, may ultimately be used to finance the expansion of our banking
operations through acquisitions of other financial institutions or branch
offices, although no such transactions are specifically being considered at this
time.


         The remaining portion of the net proceeds after the loan to our

purposes. We may initially use the remaining net proceeds to invest in deposits
at TierOne Bank, U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various
maturities, Federal funds, mortgage-backed securities, or a combination thereof.
In addition, assuming shareholder approval of the recognition and retention
plan, we intend to contribute sufficient funds to the trust so that it can
purchase a number of shares equal to an aggregate of 4% of the common stock
issued in the conversion (including shares contributed to the TierOne Charitable
Foundation). The net proceeds retained by TierOne Corporation may ultimately be
used to:

over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds from this
offering and the Direct Sale will be approximately $82.7 million. We anticipate
that, concurrently with the completion of this offering, we will enter into a
new $30.0 million revolving credit facility with Fleet National Bank to provide
additional funds to accomplish the repayments described below and to obtain
additional borrowing capacity under a revolving line of credit. We intend to
borrow the remaining amount necessary for the purposes set forth below (which

closing of the offering. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and
the Direct Sale and of our borrowings under our new credit facility for the
following purposes (in each case, assuming the payments occur on October 31,
2002):
 
    - Approximately $66.6 million will be used to repay our existing credit
      facility. This indebtedness with Fleet National Bank consists of a
      $20.0 million senior secured revolving credit facility (of which
      $14.5 million is outstanding as of November 21, 2002), which is due and
      payable on October 16, 2006, and a $55.0 million senior secured term loan
      (of which $52.0 million is outstanding as of November 21, 2002), which is
      due and payable on December 31, 2007, together with accrued and unpaid
      interest on the credit facility and the term loan. The current interest
      rate under our existing credit facility is 5.58%. The proceeds from these
      borrowings and the issuance of our senior subordinated notes were used to
      fund, in part, the Acquisition, including to purchase Thomas Black
      Corporation's stock, refinance Thomas Black Corporation's indebtedness,
      pay existing management obligations and acquisition expenses and provide
      working capital.
 
    - Approximately $30.0 million will be used to repay $30.0 million principal
      amount of 13.0% senior subordinated notes, together with accrued and
      unpaid interest.
 
    - Approximately $1.4 million will be used to pay accrued and unpaid
      dividends on our 6.0% cumulative senior preferred stock.
 
    - Any remaining net proceeds will be used for our general corporate
      purposes.
 
Our senior subordinated notes and preferred stock are held by the following
Investors: JZ Equity Partners plc; J/Z CBO (Delaware), LLC; TCW/Crescent
Mezzanine Trust III; TCW/Crescent Mezzanine Partners III, L.P.; TCW/Crescent
Mezzanine Partners III Netherlands, L.P.; and Fairholme Partners, L.P. Assuming
the underwriters do not exercise their over-allotment option, these Investors

        We will also use a portion of our net proceeds to repay loans from some 
of our stockholders. As of September 28, 2002, there was an outstanding 
principal amount of $5.0 million under these loans bearing interest at a rate 
of 8.5% per annum with a maturity date of May 31, 2007 and an additional 
$0.8 million principal amount under these loans bearing interest at a rate of 
8.5% per annum with a maturity date of September 18, 2008. In October 2002, 
these stockholders extended additional loans of $3.5 million, with an annual

of businesses. Although we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire

technologies or products.

number of factors, including but not limited to the amount of cash we generate 
from our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of

determination as to the amount of proceeds we will apply to reducing the

outstanding balance of $16.6 million on our revolving line of credit, the
principal amount of which must be repaid on or before September 30, 2007.

sale of 4,500,000 shares of common stock in this offering at the initial public 
offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount 
and estimated offering expenses, which we expect to total approximately 
$5.6 million. 

      We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay 
all indebtedness under our existing credit facility, which consists of a term 
loan and a revolving line of credit. As of September 30, 2002, there was 
outstanding approximately $2.6 million under the term loan and approximately 
$8.8 million under the revolving credit line. We use the proceeds of the 
revolving line of credit primarily for working capital purposes. In August 2002,
we borrowed $2.5 million under the revolving line of credit to fund the 
acquisition of a hospice program with approximately 85 patients in Albuquerque, 
New Mexico. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate equal to the one-month 
London Interbank Offering Rate in effect from time to time, plus 3.5%. As of 
September 30, 2002, the effective rate of interest of this loan was 5.3% per 
annum. Loans under the revolving line of credit bear interest at an annual rate 
equal to, at our option, either the “prime rate” in effect from time to time, 
as reported in the “Money Rates” section of the Wall Street Journal, plus 1.5%, 
or the one-month London Interbank Borrowing Rate in effect from time to time, 
plus 3.0%. As of September 30, 2002, the effective rate of interest on the 
revolving credit loans was 4.8% per annum. The maturity date of both the term 
loan and the revolving line of credit is April 30, 2005. 

      Our certificate of incorporation in effect prior to this offering requires 
that we redeem all outstanding shares of our Series A-2 Preferred Stock upon the 
closing of this offering. We intend to use approximately $0.3 million of the net 
proceeds of this offering to redeem those shares. 

      We also expect to use a portion of the net proceeds to finance the 
development of new hospice programs and potential acquisitions of, or strategic 
alliances with, other hospice care providers. We have not, however, allocated a 
specific amount of the net proceeds for these purposes. While we engage from time 
to time in discussions with respect to potential acquisitions and strategic 
alliances, we currently have no understandings, commitments or agreements with 
respect to any material transactions of that kind. 

      We intend to use the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes. 

      Depending on future events, we may determine at a later time to use the 
net proceeds for different purposes. Pending these uses, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

securities in exchange for participation interests with an aggregate fair 
market value of $6.0 billion, calculated using a discounted cash-flow

by and acquired from the Bank. Wachovia Preferred Holding acquired these 
participation interests from the Bank in exchange for 2,400 newly issued shares 
of Wachovia Preferred Holding’s common stock valued at $6.0 billion. We intend 
to hold these participation interests as long-term investments. 
  
Wachovia Preferred Holding, a statutory underwriter, will subsequently sell the 
15,000,000 Series A preferred securities offered hereby through an underwriting 
syndicate to the public for cash consideration of $25.00 per security. We will 
not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of our Series A preferred 
securities owned by Wachovia Preferred Holding. The proceeds, before expenses 
and commissions, to be received by Wachovia Preferred Holding from the sale of 
the 15,000,000 Series A preferred securities are expected to be $375 million in 
the aggregate. Wachovia Preferred Holding intends to use the net proceeds from 
this offering for general corporate purposes and will not use the proceeds to 
purchase additional assets for contribution to us. 
  
The Series A preferred securities are being offered for sale to increase the

at the direction of the OCC following a Supervisory Event. Wachovia will not 
receive any proceeds, directly or indirectly, from the subsequent exchange of 
the Series A preferred securities for the depositary shares."

currency. However, currently we have no plans for specific acquisitions. While,
