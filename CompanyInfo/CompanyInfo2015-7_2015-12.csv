We intend to build a 125,000 square foot LAB recycling facility at our Reno
property and have allocated a total of $22.5 million of the proceeds of this
offering towards the development of the facility, including $13 million towards
site construction and $9.5 million towards the manufacture and installation of
our AquaRefining modules, other equipment and fixtures.

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, together with our cash on
hand, will be sufficient to complete the development of the Reno recycling
facility, including the manufacture and installation of approximately eight 
AquaRefining recycling modules with a capacity, as a group, to produce 
approximately 40 metric tons of lead per day. This belief is based on our 
current assumptions and estimates concerning the costs of production and 
manufacture and the availability of materials and labor. If our assumptions or
estimates prove to be inaccurate, we may require additional funds in order to
complete our Reno facility. In addition, the expected allocation of net proceeds
set forth above represents our best estimates based upon our present plans and
our assumptions regarding industry conditions and our anticipated future
revenues and expenditures. We may find it necessary to reallocate some of the
proceeds within the above-described categories or to use portions thereof for
other purposes in order to carry out our business plan if those assumptions
change.

If the underwriters exercise their right to purchase an additional 990,000
shares of common stock to cover over-allotments, we may receive up to an
additional $4,571,325, after deducting $378,675 for underwriting discounts. We
intend to apply any net proceeds from the exercise of the overallotment option
to working capital. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the
net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities such as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial
paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

of Class A common stock, we expect to receive approximately $620.3 million of
net proceeds from the sale of the Class A common stock offered hereby based upon
the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions, the structuring fee and offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional shares of Class A common stock, we estimate that additional
net proceeds will be approximately $93.9 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions, a pro rata portion of the structuring fee and
offering expenses payable by us. We will also receive net proceeds of $62.8
million from the sale of shares of Class A common stock in connection with the
Class A Common Private Placement.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and the Class A Common
Private Placement to acquire newly issued Class A units of Global LLC,
representing 27.7% of Global LLC’s outstanding membership units after this
offering (calculated without regard to the IDRs). Global will not retain any net
proceeds from this offering or the Class A Common Private Placement.

(2)   Concurrently with the completion of this offering, Global Operating LLC     
      plans to (i) enter into the Revolver, which will provide for a revolving    
      line of credit of $485.0 million and (ii) issue the Senior Notes. The       
      closing of the Revolver and the issuance of the Senior Notes will be        
      conditioned upon completion of this offering, the implementation of our     
      Organizational Transactions and other customary closing conditions. We do   
      not expect to have any outstanding borrowings under the Revolver upon       
      completion of this offering. 

(3)   Includes net proceeds from the Units Private Placements, the Bridge Facility
      debt service reserve and unused proceeds from borrowings under the Bridge   
      Facility.                                                                   

(4)   Global LLC expects to use approximately $854.7 million of net proceeds from 
      this offering, the Class A Common Private Placement, cash on the balance    
      sheet and the offering of the Senior Notes to fund the Pending Acquisitions.
      In the event one or more of the Pending Acquisitions is not completed, the  
      net proceeds that we otherwise intend to use for such purpose will be       
      available to us for general corporate purposes, including other acquisitions
      of clean energy projects.                                                   

(5)   Includes fees and expenses related to entering into the Revolver and the    
      issuance of the Senior Notes, as well as other expenses related to the      
      Organizational Transactions not deducted from the proceeds of this offering 
      when computing net proceeds.                                                

We intend to use any net proceeds we receive as a result of the exercise of the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares to purchase Class B units and
shares of Class B common stock held by our Sponsor at a price equal to the
initial public offering price less the underwriting discounts and commissions, a
pro rata portion of the structuring fee and offering expenses payable by us.
Accordingly, we will not retain any such excess proceeds. Any such Class B units
and Class B common stock purchased from our Sponsor would be immediately
cancelled in connection with our receipt of a corresponding number of Class A
units.

The Bridge Facility will have outstanding indebtedness of approximately
$462.5 million as of the completion of this offering but prior to its repayment.
The effective interest rate on borrowings under the Bridge Facility was 8.5% as
of December 31, 2014, increased by 0.50% on May 22, 2015 and increases by 0.25%
each 90 days thereafter until maturity or the repayment of all outstanding
indebtedness under the Bridge Facility. The Bridge Facility consists of a term
loan maturing in December 2016.

J.P. Morgan Securities LLC and/or its affiliates acted as arranger of, and is
the administrative agent under, our Bridge Facility. Affiliates of each of J.P.
Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman, Sachs & Co., Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &
Smith Incorporated and Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. are lenders under the
Bridge Facility. Because affiliates of J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, Barclays
Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC will
each receive more than 5% of the net proceeds of this offering due to the
repayment of amounts outstanding under our Bridge Facility, each of J.P. Morgan
Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and Morgan
Stanley & Co. LLC is deemed to have a conflict of interest under FINRA Rule
5121. Accordingly, this offering is being made in compliance with the
requirements of FINRA Rule 5121. 

Our Sponsor will not receive any of the net proceeds or other consideration in
connection with this offering, other than (i) the net proceeds used by us to
purchase Class B units (and the related shares of Class B common stock) in the
event the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock and (ii) the Class B common stock, Class B units of Global
LLC and the IDRs issued to it in the Offering Transactions on account of its
existing ownership interest. Following completion of this offering, we may elect
to use a portion of the net proceeds to fund acquisitions from our Sponsor,
including pursuant to the Support Agreement. The Class B common stock will not
entitle our Sponsor to any economic interest in Global and the Class B units
will entitle our Sponsor, subject to certain limitations on distributions to
holders of Class B units during the Subordination Period and the Distribution
Forbearance Provisions, to a 34.3% economic interest in Global LLC."

$14,419,000, or approximately $16,678,000 if the underwriter exercises its
over-allotment option in full, based on a public offering price of $9.00 per
share and after deducting the estimated underwriting discount of $1,134,000 and
estimated offering expenses of approximately $647,500 payable by us, together
totaling approximately $1,781,000.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to expand marketing
capabilities, (ii) to repay approximately $3.0 million principal amount of
indebtedness under our April 1, 2014 $9.0 million five year term loan with Bank
Hapoalim B.M. and (iii) for working capital and general corporate purposes. The
loan from Bank Hapoalim B.M. bears interest at an annual variable rate of either
(at our option) LIBOR plus 3.5% or prime plus 0.50%. If the acquisition of the C
Wonder brand is not completed prior to the consummation of this offering, we
will use approximately $3.5 million allocated to working capital and general
corporate purposes to pay the cash portion of the purchase price for the
acquisition of the C Wonder brand and expenses related to the acquisition.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to make the
$750,000 principal payment under the IM Seller Note which is due January 31,
2016. We have the option to make this payment in cash or in stock, at our sole
discretion, subject to Bank Hapoalim B.M. approval for payment in cash. We have
not decided whether or not we will make such payment in cash or in stock.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

purposes:

• approximately $70.0 to $80.0 million to fund the Phase 3 clinical development
  of azeliragon, including the STEADFAST Study;                 

• approximately $10.0 to $15.0 million to fund our planned Phase 2 trials for
  the clinical development of our type 2 diabetes drug candidates; and  

• the remainder to fund further clinical development of our other drug 
  candidates and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.  

Entities affiliated with MacAndrews will initially bear certain costs and
expenses of this offering, including the fees of attorneys, consultants,
financial printers and auditors incurred by us, as well as certain additional
expenses incurred by such affiliated entities, currently estimated to be
approximately $4.8 million in the aggregate. We will reimburse such MacAndrews
affiliates using a portion of the gross proceeds of this offering.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our development, the
status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that
we may enter into with third parties for our drug candidates, and any unforeseen
cash needs.

Pending these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, as of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us
    $225,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering, as 
    described in this prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of
    this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting 
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital 
    expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    3.0% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $4,050,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $4,657,500 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination 
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect
    approximately $25,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the 
    funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current 
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested. In 
    addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
    intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
    sponsor or certain of our officers, directors and director nominees may, but
    are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our 
    initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the
    proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
    repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that 
    our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
    working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts
    but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned 
    amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of
    the post business combination entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the
    option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private 
    placement warrants issued to the initial stockholder. The terms of such 
    loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of our officers,
    directors and director nominees, if any, have not been determined and no 
    written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to 
    seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our 
    sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such 
    funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to 
    funds in our trust account.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $135,000,000 (or approximately $155,250,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$4,050,000 (or up to $4,657,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $25,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
taxes, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial business
combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable
to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on current interest rates,
we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to
pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general 
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on 
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund 
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities
and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination
or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $225,000, to be
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2015
or the closing of this offering. The loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the estimated $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers, directors and director nominees may, but are
not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial
business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of
the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out
of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to the initial
stockholder. The terms of such loans by our officers, directors and director
nominees, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with
respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than
our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties
will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all
rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if 
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholder has entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant to
which it has to waive its redemption rights with respect to its founder shares
and public shares in connection with the completion of their initial business
combination. In addition, our initial stockholder has agreed to waive its rights
to liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to its founder
shares if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed
time frame. However, if our initial stockholder (or any of our officers,
directors or affiliates) acquires public shares in or after this offering, they
will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial business
combination within the prescribed time frame."

    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting      
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, up to $6,300,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or up to $7,245,000 if the underwriters’              
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, with the 
    exception of amounts due to any public stockholders who exercise their      
    redemption rights, which amounts shall be paid directly from the trust 
    account to the redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be 
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general 
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred 
    underwriting discounts and commissions.    

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect    
    approximately $36,000 per year to be available to us from interest earned on
    the funds held in the trust account following the closing of this offering; 
    however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate  
    assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current yields of    
    securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order
    to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our   
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may  
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the    
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not  
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust   
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account 
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans  
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at 
    a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The   
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of 
    our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written 
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans 
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do 
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a  
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust      
    account.                                                                    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $180,000,000 (or $207,000,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$6,300,000 (or up to $7,245,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
U.S. based trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds that invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations that are compliant with Rule 2a-7 under the
Investment Company Act by meeting conditions specified under the trust agreement
filed herewith. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will
be approximately $36,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year.
We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in
the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay franchise and
income taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are 
unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of 
this offering (subject to the requirements of law and regulation) and (iii) the 
redemption of shares in connection with a vote seeking to amend Section 9.2(d) 
of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that would 
affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public 
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months 
from the closing of this offering. Based on current interest rates, we do not 
expect that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay 
taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities, secretarial support and administrative services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

As of May 4, 2015, Easterly Acquisition Sponsor, LLC, our sponsor, has loaned us
$100,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of May 31, 2016
or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such 
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such 
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not 
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M 
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if 
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the 
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any 
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will 
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination and (iii) the redemption of shares in
connection with a vote seeking to amend Section 9.2(d) of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation in a manner that would affect the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which each has agreed to waive its redemption rights with respect to its
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive its rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to its founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

stock in this offering will be $193.6 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $25.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds would be $222.5 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. Additionally, we expect to receive $17.0 million from the sale and
issuance by us of our common stock to an affiliate of Celgene Corporation in a
private placement that is expected to close concurrently with this offering.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, establish a public market for our common stock and
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets. More specifically,
we anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $6.0 million to fund expenses in connection with our Phase II 
  clinical trial for our aNK product candidate for Merkel cell carcinoma, which
  we expect will be sufficient to fund the clinical trial; 

• approximately $10.0 million to fund expenses in connection with our planned 
  Phase I/II clinical trial for Rituxan-haNK for solid tumors, which we expect 
  will be sufficient to fund the clinical trial;

• approximately $14.0 million to fund expenses in connection with our planned 
  Phase I/II clinical trials for CD33.taNK for acute myeloid leukemia and 
  PDL1.taNK for solid tumor hematological cancers, which we expect will be 
  sufficient to fund the clinical trials; 

• approximately $10.0 million to establish our planned manufacturing facility 
  and processes and the hiring of additional personnel; and

• the remaining amounts for other research and development activities, working 
  capital and general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and our
existing cash to in-license, acquire or invest in complementary business,
technologies, products or assets. However, we have no current plans, commitments
or obligations to do so.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, the concurrent private
placement and our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund
our operations through at least the next 12 months. This expected use of the net
proceeds from the offering and the concurrent private placement represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We cannot
specify with certainty all of the particular uses of the net proceeds that we
will receive from this offering, or the amounts that we will actually spend on
the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend on numerous factors, including the ongoing status of and results from
clinical trials and other studies, the product approval process with the FDA,
and the scope of our commercialization efforts, as well as any strategic
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, any unforeseen cash needs, and our investments and acquisitions. We
may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes,
and we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds. Investors will be
relying on our judgment regarding the use of the net proceeds from this
offering. Pending the use of proceeds as described above, we plan to invest the
net proceeds that we receive in the offering and the concurrent private
placement in short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade investments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government. We cannot predict whether the invested
proceeds will yield a favorable return."

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $190,750 of these expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds of loans made to us by our sponsor and one of our
    executive officers. These loans will be repaid upon the earlier of the
    completion of this offering or December 31, 2015.

(2) $50.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($57.5 million if the underwriter exercises its overallotment option in full)
    will be placed in a trust account held at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A.,
    located in the United States, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
    Company, acting as trustee.

(3) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

A total of $50.0 million (or $57.5 million if the underwriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from this offering
and the private placement will be placed in a trust account with Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be invested only in
United States government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or
in money market funds investing solely in United States Treasuries and meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act. Except for
any interest income released to us for working capital purposes or the payment
of taxes or dissolution expenses, none of the funds held in the trust account
will be released, subject to the requirements of law, until the earlier of (i)
the consummation of our initial business combination; (ii) the redemption of our
public shares if we are unable to consummate a business combination within 24
months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of the
underwriter’s overallotment option), subject to applicable law; or (iii)
otherwise upon our liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to
liquidate the trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business
combination prior to the expiration of the 24 month period (our board of
directors may determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration
if it determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the
remaining time to identify an attractive business combination or satisfy
regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a business
combination).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. If we pay for our initial business combination using stock or debt
securities, or if we do not use all of the funds released from the trust account
for payment of the purchase price in connection with our business combination,
we may use the remaining cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of
acquired businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness
incurred in consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase
of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust and interest income on the amount in the trust account that
may be released to fund working capital requirements will be sufficient to pay
our costs and expenses prior to our initial business combination. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount
necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. In addition, if we
increase or decrease the size of this offering, it would result in a
proportionate increase or decrease in the amount of interest earned in the trust
account and available to us. While we currently do not know what our future
working capital expenses will be and while they will not necessarily be
proportionate to the size of the offering, we believe that any additional
interest income earned would facilitate our ability to finance the exploration
and consideration of a greater number of potential acquisition targets.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor, Zhong Hui Holding Limited, has
loaned us $140,500, and one of our executive officers has loaned us $50,250, to
be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans, and any
subsequent loans, are and will be non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the
earlier of December 31, 2015 or the completion of this offering. In order to
fund transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
combination, our sponsor, members of our management team or their affiliates or
other third parties may loan us additional amounts, although they are under no
obligation to do so, and provided any such loans will not have any claim on the
proceeds held in the trust account unless such proceeds are released to us upon
completion of an initial business combination. If we do not consummate an
initial business combination, we may use a portion of any working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts; however, no proceeds
from the trust account may be used for such repayment, other than interest
income earned thereon. If such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts,
the unpaid amounts would be forgiven. Any part or all of such loans may be
converted into additional warrants at $0.50 per warrant (a maximum of 1,000,000
warrants if up to $500,000 is loaned and that amount is converted into warrants)
of the post-business combination entity at the option of such parties. The
warrants would be identical to the placement warrants issued to our sponsor.

The payment to an independent third party of a monthly fee of $5,000 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support although in the future, our affiliates or affiliates of our
officers, directors or sponsor, may take over the provision of these services
for amounts not exceeding $5,000 a month. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of our initial business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial stockholders, directors, officers or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the consummation of our initial business combination. We
anticipate that our initial stockholders, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates would approach a limited number of large holders of our securities
that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption of their
shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in direct
negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders approached
in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There is no
limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders, directors,
officers or their affiliates will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
during a restricted period under Regulation M under the Exchange Act or in
transaction which would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the
Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying any premium
purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the price they may
pay. We will notify stockholders of such purchases, if any, by press release,
filing a Form 8-K or by means of a supplement to our proxy statement.

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Moreover, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. If the amount of redemptions plus any cash required by our
initial business combination would cause our net tangible assets to fall below
$5,000,000, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or the
business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; or (iii) otherwise upon our liquidation or in the
event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account and ceases
to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the expiration of
the 24 month period (our board of directors may determine to liquidate the trust
account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its business judgment,
that it is improbable within the remaining time that we will be able to identify
an attractive acquisition target or satisfy regulatory and other business and
legal requirements to consummate a business combination). In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

The initial holders, including our sponsor, have agreed to waive their
redemption rights (i) with respect to their founder shares and placement shares
in connection with the consummation of a business combination and (ii) with
respect to their founder shares and placement shares if we fail to consummate a
business combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering
(excluding any exercise of the underwriter’s overallotment option) or if we
liquidate prior to the expiration of the 24 month period. However, our sponsor
and parties associated with it will be entitled to redemption rights on the same
terms as other public stockholders with respect to up to 2,000,000 of 3,000,000
public shares which may be purchased by them in this offering; they will waive
their redemption rights with respect to the remaining 1,000,000 public shares
that may be purchased by them in this offering in connection with the
consummation of a business combination."

that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $65.0 million, based
upon the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting

by us. If the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares from us is
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately
$75.0 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
access to public equity markets. We currently intend to use the net proceeds
that we will receive from this offering for as follows:

. approximately $12.1 million for pre-commercialization planning of our three
  lead product candidates, NT-0102, NT-0202 and NT-0201;

. approximately $28.7 million for commercialization of our three lead product
  candidates, if approved; and

. the remainder for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate
  purposes, including investing further in research and development efforts.

We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we
will receive from this offering or the amounts we actually spend on the uses set
forth above. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using these proceeds.
Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we plan to
invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term and
intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade investments,

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
    proceeds of a loan from our sponsor of $237,500 that we may draw down as
    described in this prospectus. This loan will be repaid upon completion of 
    this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.6%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $6,300,000, which constitutes the underwriters’
    deferred commissions (or up to $7,245,000 if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust 
    account. Based on the current interest rate environment, we would expect
    approximately $35,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the 
    funds held in the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this
    offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This
    estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current 
    yields of securities in which the trust account may be invested.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

(6) We will pay Mr. Petruska, our Chief Financial Officer, $11,650 per month
    for his services during the first 12 months following the consummation of 
    this offering and $8,300 per month thereafter (for a maximum of 12 
    additional months) and $150,000 in cash upon the successful completion of 
    our initial business combination.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $175,000,000 (or approximately $201,250,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$6,300,000 (or up to $7,245,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the
trust account will be approximately $35,000 per year, assuming an interest rate
of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
taxes or working capital expenses, until the earlier of (i) the completion of
our initial business combination or (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public
shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within 24 months from
the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of law). Based on
current interest rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust
account will be sufficient to pay taxes or a substantial portion of working
capital expenses.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to 
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek 
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or 
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to, 
or invest in, us.

We have entered into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. We will also pay Mr. Petruska, our Chief Financial Officer, as described
above.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $237,500 to be used
for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is non-interest
bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of December 31, 2015 or the closing
of this offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this offering out
of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the payment of
offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a 
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust 
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering as follows:

• first, to repay all outstanding borrowings under our $75 million Term Loan
  Facility and, to the extent sufficient net proceeds remain, to repay
  borrowings under our $30 million Revolving Credit Facility (approximately
  $44 million of the outstanding borrowings under our Term Loan Facility and
  Revolving Credit Facility were used to fund a dividend distribution to our
  stockholders in connection with the Recapitalization Transactions); and

• second, to the extent any net proceeds remain, for general corporate purposes.

As of March 29, 2015, we had $75 million of indebtedness outstanding under our
Term Loan Facility and $10 million of indebtedness outstanding under our
Revolving Credit Facility. The Term Loan Facility matures on November 26, 2019,
and as of March 29, 2015, the effective interest rate on the Term Loan Facility

March 29, 2015, the effective interest rate on the Revolving Credit Facility was
4.7%."

offering at the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us will be approximately $57.0 million, or $66.0 million if the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full.

We will have broad discretion over the use of the net proceeds in this offering.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds from this offering. We currently will use the net proceeds
to us from this offering primarily for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, sales and marketing activities, general and administrative
matters, capital expenditures and further development of our solutions.

We intend to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government, pending their use as
described above. We cannot predict whether the invested proceeds will yield a
favorable return.

Approximately $0.6 million of the net proceeds from this offering, based upon
the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, may be paid to the holder
of a warrant exercisable for 70,287 shares of our Series Alpha convertible
preferred stock, which may be exercised or settled in cash, net of the aggregate
exercise price, upon the closing of this offering.

We intend to use approximately $10.7 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the outstanding principal and accrued interest on our existing
loans with Silicon Valley Bank, which is the balance as of April 30, 2015,
assuming such repayment takes place in August 2015. Such indebtedness is being
used for general corporate purposes.

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
expand our current business through acquisitions or investments in other
complementary strategic businesses, products or technologies. We have no
commitments with respect to any acquisitions at this time.

Some of the other principal purposes of this offering are to create a public
market for our common stock and increase our visibility in the marketplace. A
public market for our common stock will facilitate future access to public
equity markets and enhance our ability to use our common stock as a means of
attracting and retaining key employees and as consideration for acquisitions."

option in full, based on the initial public offering price of $16.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. Our net proceeds from the concurrent private placement
will be $5.0 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and facilitate our
future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined with
certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering and the
concurrent private placement for working capital and other general corporate
purposes, including investments in sales and marketing in the United States and
internationally and in research and development. We also intend to use $18.6
million of the net proceeds to pay all remaining outstanding principal and
interest, together with a termination fee, under our term loan with Silicon
Valley Bank, which carries a current interest rate of 12% and expires in
December 2017. We may also use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for
acquisitions or strategic investments in complementary businesses or
technologies, although we do not currently have any plans for any such
acquisitions or investments. We have not allocated specific amounts of net
proceeds for any of these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent private
placement represents our intentions based upon our present plans and business
conditions. We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses
set forth above. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The timing and amount of our
actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows from
operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending their use, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in a variety of
capital-preservation investments, including short- and intermediate-term,
interest-bearing investment-grade securities."

underwriters also have the option to purchase up to an additional 1,338,750
shares of common stock from us. We estimate the net proceeds to us, if the
underwriters exercise their right to purchase the maximum of 1,338,750
additional shares of common stock from us, will be approximately $150.0 million
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us in connection with this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay $130.1 million in
aggregate principal amount of outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, out of which $50.0 million will be used to repay borrowings
under the Revolving Credit Facility and $80.1 million will be used to repay
borrowings under our Term Loan Facility.

The outstanding borrowings under our Revolving Credit Facility were used to pay
an aggregate cash dividend of $48.8 million to holders of our common stock and
an aggregate of $1.2 million of related fees and expenses. Our Term Loan
Facility will mature on September 28, 2019 and as of May 2, 2015, bears interest
at a rate of 3.75% plus LIBOR, which is subject to a floor of 1.0%. Our
Revolving Credit Facility will mature on September 28, 2017 and as of June 30,
2015, the $50.0 million outstanding bears interest at a rate of 2.0%. 

If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised
in full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of $20.0
million, which we intend to use to repay additional outstanding indebtedness
under our Term Loan Facility.

An affiliate of KeyBanc Capital Markets Inc. is a lender under our Revolving
Credit Facility and will receive 5% or more of the net proceeds of this
offering. As a result, this offering will be conducted in accordance with FINRA

underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full.

We currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

• approximately $43.0 million to fund our ongoing Wolverine Phase 2 trial, our 
  planned Brighton Phase 2 trial that we expect to initiate in mid-2015 and 
  manufacturing activities related to these trials;               

• approximately $40.0 million to fund other planned future Phase 2 trials   
  related to PNT2258 and manufacturing activities related to these trials;  

• approximately $5.0 million to support non-clinical activities and preclinical
  activities related to PNT2258, including activities related to its mechanism 
  of action; and                                             

• approximately $7.0 million to further develop our DNAi technology platform and
  broaden our pipeline of DNAi-based product candidates.                

The remainder of the net proceeds will be used for working capital and other
general corporate purposes as well as to pay the approximately $5.5 million of
cumulative accrued dividends to our Series B and Series B-1 redeemable
convertible preferred stockholders. We may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds to acquire, license and invest in complementary products, technologies
or businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to do so.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including the status and results of the Phase 2 Wolverine and Brighton
clinical trials for PNT2258. Although it is difficult to predict additional
capital requirements, we believe that the net proceeds from this offering and
our existing cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments will be
sufficient to fund our current operating plans through at least the next
18 months, which we expect will allow us to achieve clinical data read-outs for
our Wolverine and Brighton Phase 2 clinical trials. We anticipate that we will
need additional funding to complete these and our other planned clinical trials.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, feedback from regulatory authorities,
the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for our current and future product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such as money market
accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations
of the U.S. government."

us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by
providing them with equity incentives, and obtain additional capital. We plan to
use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

. US$11.3 million to set up new client centers and expand our coverage network,

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, as an offshore holding company of

China in an offshore transaction. However, most of these uses are subject to PRC
regulations and approvals. For example:

• loans by us to our wholly-owned subsidiary in China, which is a 
  foreign-invested enterprise, cannot exceed statutory limit and must be    
  registered with SAFE or its local counterparts. The statutory limit for the 
  total amount of foreign debt to be incurred by a foreign-invested enterprise 
  is the difference between the amount of total investment as approved by the 
  Ministry of Commerce or its local counterpart and the amount of registered 
  capital of such foreign-invested enterprise. For example, the current amounts 
  of approved total investment and registered capital of Hailiang Consulting are 
  US$6 million and US$3 million, respectively. This means Hailiang Consulting 
  cannot obtain loans in excess of US$3 million from entities outside of China. 
  However, we may from time to time further increase such statutory limit by 
  making additional capital contributions and increase the total investment 
  amount to Hailiang Consulting, thereby increasing the statutory limit of the 
  loans Hailiang Consulting may obtain in the future based on our operational 
  needs;       

• loans by us to our affiliated entities, which are domestic PRC entities,over a 
  certain threshold must be approved by the relevant government authorities and 
  must also be registered with SAFE or its local counterparts; and                                                         

• capital contributions to our wholly-owned subsidiary must be approved by the 
  MOFCOM or its local counterparts.                                     

We intend to use the majority of proceeds from this offering for acquisitions
although we are not currently negotiating any acquisitions. In addition to
acquisitions, we currently expect that a portion of the proceeds of this 
offering will be used by Hailiang Consulting to provide better support to the
operations of our affiliated entities. Specifically, Hailiang Consulting will
make substantial investments with respect to leasehold improvements at our
schools, marketing to enhance our brand, recruitment of additional
administrative staff and enhancement of our information technology systems.
These uses of proceeds are for purposes within the business scope of Hailiang
Consulting. Hailiang Consulting received the necessary approvals from the
relevant PRC regulatory authority to include leasehold improvements within its
business scope in October 2014.

Meanwhile, we believe that our affiliated entities will have adequate cash from
their operations to support their own operation and expansion. However, if
needed, we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain the government
registrations or approvals required to transfer offering proceeds to our PRC
subsidiaries or affiliated entities on a timely basis, if at all. If we fail to
satisfy these requirements on a timely basis, our ability to remit the funds
received from this offering to capitalize our PRC operations may be negatively
affected, which could adversely affect our liquidity and our ability to fund and
expand our business."

stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions

$163.7 million, or approximately $188.8 million if the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option in full, based on an initial public offering price
of $18.00 per share.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace, create a public market
for our common stock, obtain additional working capital and facilitate our
future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use
approximately $63.7 million of the net proceeds received by us from this
offering for working capital and general corporate purposes and approximately
$100.0 million for continued investments in research and development for our
core technology and development of our product offerings. In addition, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds received by us from this offering for
acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. However,
we have no current understandings, agreements or commitments for any material
acquisitions at this time, and we have not allocated specific amounts of the net
proceeds received by us from this offering for any of these purposes. We have
not yet determined the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds
received by us from this offering, and as a result, management will have broad
discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds.

Pending our use of the net proceeds received by us from this offering, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term,
interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

• approximately $59 million to expand and support our sales and marketing 
  efforts;

• approximately $26 million to fund research, development and clinical

• the remaining proceeds for working capital and other general corporate

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current 
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary products or
technologies or acquisitions of companies with complementary products or
technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds for these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors 
including the degree and rate of market acceptance of, and the amount of revenue 
derived from, our products, including our iTotal PS product which is currently 
in limited commercial launch, the timing of U.S. and EU regulatory clearance and 
commercial launch of our iTotal Hip, the progress of our plans to expand and 
further vertically integrate our manufacturing processes and facilities and the 
size, scope and timing of any additional research and development efforts and 
clinical studies that we may decide to pursue for our current products or future 
product candidates. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion 
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

additional net proceeds of approximately $3.08 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, increase our visibility in the marketplace and create a
public market for our common stock. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the approximate $13.13 million principal amount of our 16%
senior subordinated note due March 16, 2018, together with accrued interest
through the date of payment. $11.50 million principal amount of the 16% senior

An additional $1.50 million principal amount of the note was issued in December
2013 to finance, in part, the acquisition of the PTI Business. The remaining
$0.13 million principal amount was issued to pay interest in kind. We will use
proceeds remaining after payment of the 16% senior subordinated note, including
any proceeds we receive if the over-allotment is exercised by our underwriters,
to temporarily reduce borrowings under the revolver portion of our senior
secured credit facility which matures on March 15, 2018. Borrowings under the
revolver portion of our senior secured credit facility are subject to a
borrowing base and bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 30 day LIBOR plus
a margin that ranges from 2.75% to 3.25%. At March 29, 2015, the effective
interest rate was 3.18% per annum. Amounts paid under the facility will be
available to be re-borrowed, subject to our compliance with the terms of the
facility. Borrowings under the revolver portion of our senior secured credit 
facility are used for general corporate purposes, including working capital, 
sales and marketing activities and general and administrative matters.

credit facility, including any proceeds we receive if the overallotment option
is exercised by our underwriters. We may use net proceeds in ways that do not
necessarily improve our results of operations or enhance the value of our common

• approximately US$5.5 million for development of Hepbarna for hepatitis B,  
  for pre-clinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept and
  through to submission of an IND application;

• approximately US$2 million for development of the OPMD program, for
  pre-clinical studies intended to establish in vivo proof of concept and
  through to submission of an IND application; and

equivalents, will be sufficient to advance our product candidate for hepatitis C

hepatitis B and OPMD through completion of pre-clinical proof of concept trials
and to submission of IND applications; and to advance our product candidate for
AMD through completion of pre-clinical trials, submission of an IND application
and initiation of a clinical trial. Advancing our product candidate for NSCLC
through completion of pre-clinical trials, and advancing our product candidates
for hepatitis B and OPMD into clinical trials, would require additional
financing apart from this offering. As of June 30, 2015, our cash and cash
equivalents were A$21.8 million.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research and
development efforts, the progress of our clinical trials, our operating costs.
Accordingly, we retain the discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering and we reserve the right to change the allocation of the net proceeds
described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
investment grade, interest-bearing instruments, securities or certificates of
deposit."

    business combination, up to $12,250,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or up to $14,087,500 if the underwriters’              
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination 
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.            

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than            
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately      
    $140,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the 
    trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering; however,
    we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an 
    interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current yields of securities in  
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance    
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business            
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our    
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be
    required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay    
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the     
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not   
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust    
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account  
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans   
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at a
    price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would be
    identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms 
    of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of our    
    officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written      
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans  
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do  
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a   
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust       
    account.                                                                     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a ‘no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $350,000,000 (or approximately $402,500,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$12,250,000 (or up to $14,087,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a
trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee
and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of
180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate
that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $70,000 per
year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year. We will not be permitted to
withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account, except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering will
not be released from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion
of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares
properly tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and
(iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete
our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering,
subject to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect
that interest earned on the trust account will be sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 to be
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2015
or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $900,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their 
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either 
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination. 
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such 
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M 
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if 
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any 
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

$28.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately
$33.3 million.

We expect to use $17.1 million (the estimated balance on our Revolver plus
accrued interest upon completion of this offering) of the net proceeds from this
offering to pay down our senior debt, $6.3 million (or $3.2 million after
netting out the proceeds from preferred shareholders who have agreed to use such
proceeds to purchase common stock) to repurchase outstanding preferred stock and
pay accrued preferred stock dividends and the balance of the proceeds to fund
the growth of our operating subsidiaries and for general corporate purposes. Our
preferred stock is perpetual, bears interest at 10% per year on the original
issue price, and accrues paid-in-kind (""PIK"") interest at 4% per year,
compounded quarterly. The PIK interest is payable upon redemption.

In September 2014, the Company entered into an amended and restated credit
agreement which increased the total amount available to borrow under the
Revolver from $10 million to $17.5 million and provided for a new term note for
$7.5 million. The additional borrowings were invested in our operating insurance
subsidiaries to support their continued growth.

Our credit facility consists of our $17.5 million Revolver, which matures August
1, 2016, and two term notes of $7.5 million (the ""2014 Term Note"") and $5.0
million (the ""Original Term Note""). The 2014 Term Note matures September 29,
2019 and the Original Term Note matures July 1, 2018. The interest rate of the
Revolver and the Original Term Note at December 31, 2014 and March 31, 2015 was
LIBOR (as defined in the credit facility) plus 2.75%. The interest rate of the
2014 Term Note is LIBOR plus 3.25%. At March 31, 2015, we had $28.2 million of
borrowings outstanding under our credit facility, with $17.5 million of
borrowings on the Revolver. We had $38,000 of borrowings availability under the
Revolver at March 31, 2015."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,
    the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee
    and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    received from Lodestar Investment Holdings I LLC, an affiliate of Richard Xu
    described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
    offering available to us.

(2) The underwriting discount of 3.0% is payable at the closing of the offering
    and the deferred underwriting fee of 1.5% (and 4.5% on gross proceeds
    received from the over-allotment option) payable to Cantor Fitzgerald & Co. is
    payable upon consummation of our initial business combination and will be
    held in the trust account until consummation of such business combination.
    Additionally, in the event that investors introduced by us to the
    underwriter do not purchase at least $20,000,000 of the units being offered
    hereby, there will be an additional underwriting commission paid to the
    underwriter in the amount of $0.15 per unit (1.5%) on the amount below
    $20,000,000 invested by investors introduced by us, which will not affect
    the amount in trust due to the obligation of our initial shareholders to
    purchase commission units. No discounts or commissions will be paid with
    respect to the purchase of the private units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $600,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income earned on
    the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such
    interest income) will be available to us to pay for our working capital
    requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be
    approximately $30,000 over a 18-month period assuming an interest rate of
    approximately 0.05% per year.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

An affiliate of Richard Xu, our Executive Chairman and Chief Executive Officer,
has committed to purchase an aggregate of 310,000 private units at a price of
$10.00 per unit ($3,100,000 in the aggregate). This affiliate has also agreed
that if investors introduced by us to the underwriter do not purchase at least
$20,000,000 of the units being offered hereby, it will purchase from us at a
price of $10.00 per unit the number of commission units (up to an aggregate of
110,000 commission units) that will equal the increased commissions we will pay
the underwriter, as described above, and to cover the additional $0.40 that
public investors may receive upon conversion or liquidation to total $10.40 per
share, as described elsewhere herein. All of the proceeds we receive from these
purchases will be placed in the trust account described below.

$40,800,000, or $46,800,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private units will be
placed in an account at Morgan Stanley in the United States, maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income
or other tax obligations and (ii) any remaining interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$600,000. In addition, interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
(after payment of taxes owed on such interest income) may be released to us to
fund our working capital requirements in searching for a business combination.
We intend to use the excess working capital available for miscellaneous expenses
such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target
business and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the
balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our initial shareholders, officers and directors in connection with
activities on our behalf as described above.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our share capital is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, Richard Xu and Chen Liu have
agreed to advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and have agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of March 31, 2015, Lodestar Investment Holdings I LLC, an affiliate of
Richard Xu, loaned to us an aggregate of $115,000 to be used to pay a portion of
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. In April
2015, Lodestar Investment Holdings I LLC loaned us an additional $50,000. The
loans are payable without interest on the earlier of (i) October 31, 2015, (ii)
the date on which we consummate our initial public offering or (iii) the date on
which we determine to not proceed with our initial public offering. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 18 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our initial shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but
are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a promissory note. The notes would either be paid upon
consummation of our initial business combination, without interest, or, at the
lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted upon
consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 55,000 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the
50,000 rights included in the private units would result in the issuance of
5,000 ordinary shares upon the closing of our business combination). Our
shareholders have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities
upon conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert
them at the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we
do not complete our initial business combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such shares in
connection with a business combination which we consummate or a vote to amend
the provisions of our amended and restated memorandum and articles of
association relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination
activity. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or
interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

this offering will be approximately $109.4 million, or $126.1 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, based
upon the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering and our cash and cash
equivalents on hand as follows:

• approximately $50.0 million to fund our development of GBT440 for the
  treatment of SCD, including the completion of our ongoing Phase 1/2 clinical
  trial, planned clinical pharmacology studies and through the initiation of a
  pivotal clinical trial;                                   

• approximately $15.0 million to conduct clinical trials of GBT440 or its
  analogs for the treatment of hypoxemic pulmonary disorders;               

• approximately $15.0 million to complete and file an IND and begin a Phase 1/2
  clinical trial of an oral kallikrein inhibitor for the treatment of HAE; and

• the remaining proceeds to fund new and ongoing research and development  
  activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may
  include funding for the hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures
  and the costs of operating as a public company.              

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash and cash equivalents, together
with the net proceeds to us from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through early 2017.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in new businesses, technology or assets. We are currently in active discussions
with the Regents of the University of California, or the Regents, to obtain an
exclusive license on commercially reasonable terms to the Regents’ interest in
any GBT440 and GBT440 analog patent rights that we may jointly own with the
Regents. Although we have no other specific agreements, commitments or
understandings with respect to any in-license or acquisition, we evaluate such
opportunities and engage in related discussions with other companies from time
to time.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our preclinical and clinical
development activities may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and results
from non-clinical studies and our ongoing clinical trial or any clinical trials
we may commence in the future, our ability to take advantage of expedited
programs or to obtain regulatory approval for GBT440 and any other product
candidates we may identify and pursue, the timing and costs associated with the
manufacture and supply of GBT440 and any other product candidates we may
identify and pursue for clinical development or commercialization, and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

stock in this offering will be approximately $145.3 million at the initial
public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we
estimate that net proceeds will be approximately $167.6 million after deducting
the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $80.0 million to $90.0 million to fund the continued clinical 
  development of AR101, including to fund our planned Phase 3 registration trial
  through data readout;                                

• approximately $30.0 million to $35.0 million to fund the development of 
  additional product candidates; and                                      

• the remainder, if any, for working capital and general corporate purposes.

However, due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and
regulatory approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the
exact amounts of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for the
above purposes. As such, our management will retain broad discretion over the
use of the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including (i) the time and cost
necessary to implement our anticipated Phase 3 registration trial of AR101;
(ii) the time and cost associated with clinical trials and pre-clinical
development of other product candidates; (iii) our ability to obtain regulatory
approval for and subsequently commercialize AR101 or any other product
candidates we develop; and (iv) the time and cost necessary to develop clinical
supplies and a commercial-scale manufacturing process for AR101.

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, together with the net
proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to fund our planned operations
for the 24 months following the date of this offering. Following this offering,
we will require substantial capital in order to commercialize AR101 and complete
the clinical development of any additional product candidate.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to purchase 9,122,657 issued
and outstanding Holdings Units from certain Continuing LLC Owners consisting of
investment funds affiliated with TSG that they will have received in the
Reclassification (or 10,491,055 Holdings Units if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock), at a
purchase price per unit equal to the initial public offering price per share of

Continuing LLC Owners issued to them in the Reclassification, which is in
addition to the Holdings Units that we acquire in the Reclassification on a
one-for-one basis in relation to the number of shares of Class A common stock
issued to the Direct TSG Investors in the Merger. Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC will not
receive any proceeds that we use to purchase Holdings Units from Continuing LLC
Owners.

The Direct TSG Investors, who will not have received Holdings Units in the
Reclassification but rather will have received shares of Class A common stock in
the Merger, will sell a portion of those shares of Class A common stock in this
offering as selling stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale
of shares by the selling stockholders. After deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions, the selling stockholders will receive approximately
$65.5 million of net proceeds from this offering.

Pla-Fit Holdings, LLC will bear or reimburse Planet Fitness, Inc. and the
selling stockholders for all of the expenses incurred in connection with this

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the
net proceeds from this offering for the following purposes:

. approximately $16.4 million in the aggregate to fund the development efforts
  of ZYN002 for its target indications through Phase 2, of which we expect:

. approximately $9.9 million will fund the general development efforts, 
  including preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials; and
          
. approximately $6.5 million in the aggregate will fund three Phase 2a clinical
  trials, one for each target indication of refractory epilepsy, FXS and OA;

. approximately $14.2 million in the aggregate to fund the development efforts
  of ZYN001 for its target indications through Phase 2, of which we expect:
            
. approximately $9.7 million will fund the general development efforts, 
  including preclinical studies and Phase 1 clinical trials; and
             
. approximately $4.5 million in the aggregate will fund two Phase 2a clinical
  trials, one for each target indication of fibromyalgia and peripheral
  neuropathic pain.

purposes.

We may also use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to in-license, acquire,
or invest in complementary businesses, intellectual property, products or
assets. However, we have no current commitments or obligations to do so.

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital
requirements for the next 24 months. We believe that these available funds will
be sufficient to complete (i) Phase 1 clinical trials for ZYN002 and three
Phase 2a clinical trials for this product candidate, one for each target
indication of refractory epilepsy, FXS and OA and (ii) Phase 1 clinical trials
for ZYN001 and two Phase 2a clinical trials for this product candidate, one for
each target indication of fibromyalgia and peripheral neuropathic pain. The
progress of ZYN002 and ZYN001 for each target indication is uncertain due to
numerous factors, including, without limitation, the rate of progress of
clinical trials, the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials for such
indication, the costs and timing of seeking and obtaining FDA, DEA and other
regulatory approvals for clinical trials and FDA guidance regarding clinical
trials for such indication. In addition, it is difficult to predict our required
spending for our product candidates prior to obtaining FDA approval. Moreover,
changing circumstances may cause us to expend cash significantly faster than we
currently anticipate, and we may need to spend more cash than currently expected
because of circumstances beyond our control.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering, or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will vary depending on numerous
factors, including our ability to gain access to additional financing, the
relative success and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development
programs and whether we are able to enter into future licensing arrangements. As
a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
    of the $850,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts 
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, up to $12,250,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or up to $14,087,500 if the underwriters' 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be 
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination 
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $350,000,000 (or $402,500,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including up to $12,250,000 (or up to $14,087,500
if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $35,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.01% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held
in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income
tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of (a) the completion of our initial business
combination or (b) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering (or 27 months, as applicable), subject to applicable law. Based on
current interest rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust
account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise
taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay 
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general 
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on 
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund 
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the 
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in 
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities, 
secretarial support and administrative services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly 
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to 
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 
2015 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing 
of this offering out of the $850,000 of offering proceeds that has been 
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do 
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account 
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business 
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our Class A common
stock that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the 
limitations described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we 
are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months following the 
closing of this offering (or 27 months from the closing of this offering if we 
have executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
for an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering but have not completed the initial business combination within such 
24-month period), subject to applicable law and as further described herein and
any limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant 
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our 
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with 
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."
NABRIVA THERAPEUTICS PLC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/nabriva-therapeutics-plc-968401-78736,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/nabriva-therapeutics-plc-968401-78736,424B4,9/21/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=10919817,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $79.5 million (€71.3 million), based on the initial public
offering price of $10.25 per ADS, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase additional ADSs to cover
over-allotments, we estimate that the net proceeds of the offering will be
approximately $92.2 million (€82.7 million) after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

As of June 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately
€34.9 million ($38.9 million). As of June 30, 2015, there was approximately
€3.9 million ($4.3 million) principal amount of debt outstanding under our loan
agreement with Kreos Capital IV (UK) Limited, or Kreos. The loan bears an annual
interest rate of 11.9% and provides for equal monthly installment payments of
€0.2 million, including interest payments, through maturity in July 2017. We
expect to use approximately €0.3 million of the net proceeds from this offering
to make a one-time payment of a profit share fee to the Austria
Wirtschaftsservice GmbH. We currently estimate that we will use the remaining
net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $80.0 million (€71.7 million) to fund the clinical development 
  of lefamulin for CABP; 

• approximately $3.0 million (€2.7 million) to pursue the clinical development 
  of lefamulin for additional indications and for earlier stage research and 
  development activities;

• approximately $4.9 million (€4.4 million) for the scheduled payments of
  principal and interest under our loan agreement with Kreos through July 2017;
  and 

• the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from
clinical trials, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third
parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management retains broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings
for any material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or
technologies.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering, we estimate
that such funds, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be
sufficient to enable us to obtain top-line data for our two international Phase
3 clinical trials of lefamulin for the treatment of moderate to severe CABP. We
have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could
use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect. While we
anticipate that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to allow us to obtain top-line
data for our two international Phase 3 clinical trials of lefamulin for the
treatment of moderate to severe CABP, the net proceeds may not be sufficient to
allow us to submit applications for marketing approval for lefamulin for the
treatment of CABP in the United States and Europe. We also do not expect the net
proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to complete the clinical
development of lefamulin for any other indications.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including term
deposits, short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S.
government securities."

$108.1 million, or approximately $124.9 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares from us in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and enable
access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders. We intend to
use the net proceeds from this offering for product development, including
research and development and clinical trials, expansion of our salesforce and
for working capital and general corporate purposes. From time to time, we may
consider the acquisition of complementary technologies or businesses, though we
have no agreements or understandings with respect to any such acquisitions at
this time. We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds
that we receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion
in using these proceeds. Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering,
we intend to invest the net proceeds in investment grade, interest bearing

underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this offering is exercised
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $144.9 million.

As of June 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $85.2 million. We
intend to use net proceeds from this offering, together with existing cash
resources, as follows:

• approximately $15.0 million to fund external research and development expenses
  to advance our lead product candidate RGX-501 for the treatment of HoFH 
  through Phase I/II clinical trials;                               

• approximately $13.0 million to fund external research and development expenses

  Phase I/II clinical trials;                                     

• approximately $10.0 million to fund external research and development expenses
  to advance our product candidate RGX-314 for the treatment of wet AMD through
  filing of an IND in preparation for a Phase I clinical trial; 

• approximately $23.0 million to fund research and development expenses of our
  other internally developed product candidates and to identify and advance new
  programs or product candidates into preclinical studies; and  

• the remainder for working capital, general and administrative expenses, 
  internal research and development expenses, manufacturing and other general
  corporate purposes, including in-licenses and potential acquisitions.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary products or
technologies or acquisitions of companies with complementary products or
technologies. We have no current agreements, commitments or understandings for
any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time; however, we may use a
portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts we
actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our current
intentions and will depend upon a number of factors, including future sales
growth, success of our product development and commercialization efforts, cash
generated from future operations, if any, and actual expenses to operate our
business. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty
all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing
of this offering. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of this
offering.

Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in
a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their    
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business  
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans 
    from our sponsor of $300,000 as described in this prospectus. These loans    
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of     
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering        
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in 
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set  
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working  
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as   
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the  
    trust account.                                                               

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial       
    business combination, up to $14,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’              
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters 
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be    
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price 
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination    
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or  
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business    
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on 
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in 
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust     
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately      
    $80,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in the  
    trust account over 12 months following the investment of such funds in       
    specified U.S. Government Treasury bills beginning in January 2016; however, 
    we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an 
    interest rate of 0.02% per annum based upon current yields of securities in  
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance    
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business            
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our    
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may 
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay    
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. 
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the     
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not   
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust    
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account  
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans   
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at
    a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would 
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The 
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of
    our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans  
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do  
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a   
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust       
    account.                                                                     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    business combination to fund a ‘no shop” provision and commitment fees for   
    financing.                                                                   

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, approximately $400,000,000 (or approximately $460,000,000 if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to
$14,000,000 (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will, upon the
consummation of this offering, be placed in a non-interest bearing U.S.-based
trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee. Beginning in January 2016, the funds in the
trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. Based on current interest rates, we
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$80,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% per year, following the
investment of such funds in specified U.S. government treasury bills or in
specified money market funds beginning in January 2016. We will not be permitted
to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except
for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes, if any, the proceeds from this
offering will not be released from the trust account until the earliest
of (i) the completion of our initial business combination, (ii) the redemption
of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to
amend our amended and restated memorandum and articles of association to modify
the substance and timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares 
if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the 
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest 
rates, we do not expect that interest earned on the trust account will be 
sufficient to pay taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 to be
used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31, 2015
or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds 
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our 
trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the
redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders, officers
and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to
complete our business combination within the prescribed time frame. However, if
our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) In addition, a portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the     
    proceeds of loans from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this   
    prospectus. These loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out 
    of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
    of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
    offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts   
    will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.                     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions of           
    approximately 3.833% (or 4.05% if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
    exercised in full) of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon and         
    concurrently with the completion of our initial business combination, up to 
    $18,400,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or up
    to $22,360,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in   
    full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust     
    account. The remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay 
    all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with 
    which our initial business combination occurs or for general corporate 
    purposes, including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness 
    incurred in connection with our initial business combination, to fund the 
    purchases of other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will 
    not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting 
    discounts and commissions.             

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the $489.75 million in proceeds we receive from this offering and the sale of
the private placement warrants described in this prospectus, or approximately
$561.75 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
$480 million ($10.00 per unit), or approximately $552 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full ($10.00 per unit), will
be deposited into a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and $9.75 million will be used to pay expenses in
connection with the closing of this offering and for working capital following
this offering. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in
U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We
estimate the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $48,000
per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.01% per year. We expect that the
interest earned on funds placed in the trust account will be sufficient to pay
our income taxes. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or
interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay
income taxes, if any, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered
in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, or
(iii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are unable to complete a
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (subject
to the requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will reimburse an affiliate of our sponsor for office space, secretarial and
administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an amount
not to exceed $15,000 per month in the event such space and/or services are
utilized and we do not pay a third party directly for such services. Upon
completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease
paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of December 31,
2015 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing
of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

Each warrant would be exercisable for one-half of one Class A ordinary share.
Warrants may be exercised only for a whole number of Class A ordinary shares. No
fractional shares will be issued upon exercise of the warrants. If, upon
exercise of the warrants, a holder would be entitled to receive a fractional
interest in a share, we will, upon exercise, round down to the nearest whole
number the number of Class A ordinary shares to be issued to the warrant holder.
As a result, warrant holders not purchasing an even number of warrants must sell
any odd number of warrants in order to obtain full value from the fractional
interest that will not be issued.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial shareholders, directors, executive officers,
advisors or their affiliates may also purchase shares or public warrants in
privately negotiated transactions either prior to or following the completion of
our initial business combination. However, other than as expressly stated 
herein, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such 
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such 
transactions. None of the funds in the trust account will be used to purchase 
shares or public warrants in such transaction. If they engage in such 
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession 
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

Subsequent to the consummation of this offering, we will adopt an insider
trading policy which will require insiders to: (i) refrain from purchasing our
securities during certain blackout periods and when they are in possession of
any material non-public information and (ii) clear all trades with our legal
counsel prior to execution. We cannot currently determine whether our insiders
will make such purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan, as it will be dependent
upon several factors, including but not limited to, the timing and size of such
purchases. Depending on such circumstances, our insiders may either make such
purchases pursuant to a Rule 10b5-1 plan or determine that such a plan is not
necessary.

The purpose of any such purchases of shares could be to vote such shares in
favor of the business combination and thereby increase the likelihood of
obtaining shareholder approval of the business combination or to satisfy a
closing condition in an agreement with a target that requires us to have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash at the closing of our business
combination, where it appears that such requirement would otherwise not be met.
The purpose of any such purchases of public warrants could be to reduce the
number of public warrants outstanding or to vote such warrants on any matters
submitted to the warrantholders for approval in connection with our initial
business combination. Any such purchases of our securities may result in the
completion of our business combination that may not otherwise have been
possible. In addition, if such purchases are made, the public “float” of our
Class A ordinary shares or warrants may be reduced and the number of beneficial
holders of our securities may be reduced, which may make it difficult to
maintain or obtain the quotation, listing or trading of our securities on a
national securities exchange.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those Class A ordinary shares that
such shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed 
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with 
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination 
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our 
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this 
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust 
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial 
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

this offering will be approximately $48.1 million, or $55.7 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, based
on the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, plus, if needed, cash on
hand, as follows:

• approximately $35.0 million to fund the clinical development of MYK-461
  through the completion of our planned Phase 2 clinical trials;

• approximately $25.0 million to advance our ongoing preclinical, discovery and
  research programs and the expansion of our platform, including SHaRe; and

• the remaining proceeds, if any, to fund new and ongoing research and
  development activities, working capital and other general corporate purposes.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire or invest
in new businesses, technology or assets. Although we have no specific
agreements, commitments or understandings with respect to any in-license or
acquisition, we evaluate such opportunities and engage in related discussions
with other companies from time to time.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of our preclinical and clinical
development activities may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress of our development efforts, including the number of
product candidates we intend to develop, the status of and results from
preclinical studies and our ongoing clinical trials or any clinical trials we
may commence in the future or to obtain regulatory approval for MYK-461 and any
other product candidates we may identify and pursue, the timing of, and our
ability to receive, any funding pursuant to our collaboration with Sanofi, the
timing and costs associated with the manufacture and supply of MYK-461 and any
other product candidates we may identify and pursue for clinical development or
commercialization, and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management
will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and U.S. government
securities."

this offering will be approximately $20.8 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $5.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’
over-allotment option to purchase additional shares in this offering is
exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately
$24.2 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. We expect to use the net proceeds that we receive
from this offering for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
including research and development activities, sales and marketing activities
and capital expenditures, to enhance existing and develop new products and
product families, expand our manufacturing capabilities or fund our growth. We
may also use a portion of the net proceeds that we receive from this offering
for investments in or acquisitions of complementary businesses, products,
services, technologies or other assets. We have not entered into any agreements
or commitments with respect to any investments or acquisitions at this time.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to
repay borrowings under our three-year $15.0 million term loan facility. As of
June 30, 2015, we had borrowings of $15.0 million outstanding under the term
loan facility, which bear interest at a rate of 5.25% per year. Our term loan
facility replaced our prior credit facility. We used the borrowings under our
term loan facility to repay in full the total borrowings outstanding under the
prior credit facility as of the date we entered into the term loan facility.

We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds that we
receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using
these proceeds. Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

    fee and an expense reimbursement capped at 1% of the offering price for all 
    units sold in the offering. Our estimated offering expenses, excluding the

We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering for operating and general
corporate purposes. The principal purposes of the offering are to provide
capital to acquire Accounts and to otherwise provide us with financial
flexibility to support future growth. We may use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering to pursue acquisitions of other Account servicing businesses
and expansions of the products that we offer in existing and new markets.
However, we have no commitments with respect to any such acquisition, investment
or product expansion, and we are not currently involved in any negotiations with
respect to any of the foregoing.

As of the date of this prospectus, we intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering in materially the following manner:

In the event that we sell only the minimum number of units offered and therefore
receive only the minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working
capital with which to pursue the foregoing. Pending the use by us of such
proceeds, we will invest such proceeds in interest-bearing securities consistent
with our current investment policies."

of approximately $7.3 million based on an offering price of $4.06 per ADS and
$0.0025 per Warrant, assuming no exercise of the overallotment option, or
approximately $8.54 million if the underwriters exercise the overallotment
option in full, in each case after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses of the offering payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as follows:

• approximately $4.3 million to fund new clinical trials and other regulatory
  requirements of our product and product candidates;

• approximately $2.0 million to fund production development, including
  validation batches; and

• approximately $1.0 million for other general corporate purposes, including
  employees, rent, and costs and expenses of being a U.S. public company.

Of the total use of proceeds of USD 4.3 million that are planned to be used for
clinical trials, the Company plans to allocate approximately USD 1.5 million to
animal health studies, approximately USD 2.5 million to human health studies and
approximately USD 0.3 million to a XR-17 pharmacokinetic study.

For the animal health, Oasmia has been granted conditional approval in the US by
the FDA of Paccal Vet-CA1 for the treatment of mammary carcinoma and squamous
cell carcinoma in dogs. In order to apply for a full approval for these
indications, Oasmia is planning a Phase III study for each indication. With the
allocated funds of approximately USD 1.0 million, we estimate being able to
reach approximately 15 – 20% of completion. The Company also plans to allocate
USD 0.5 million to continue a Phase II study with Doxophos Vet the primary goal
of which is to assess response rate in the treated dogs. The study will continue
throughout 2016 and with the allocated funds the study is estimated to reach
completion. The Phase II study will form the basis for a conditional approval
application in the US for the treatment of lymphoma in dogs.

For human health, the Company plans to allocate approximately USD 2.5 million in
total whereof USD 1.5 million to Docecal, approximately USD 0.2 million to
Doxophos and USD 1.5 million to Paclical. For Docecal, the plan is to start a
clinical Phase I study and a safety and tolerance study. With the allocated
funds Oasmia estimates being able to reach 50% and 15% completion, respectively.
The Company plans to initiate a Paclical study for the breast cancer indication
and intends to allocate USD 0.3 million for this purpose. The estimated
completion rate for the Paclical study will be less than 10%.

The Company plans to spend approximately USD 3.0 million on product development,
mainly scale up of production at our contract manufacturing partner, Baxter
Oncology GmbH in Germany. The proceeds will include cost for validation batches
and be equally allocated among Paclical, Docecal and Doxophos.

The expected use of the net proceeds we receive from this offering represent our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenses may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion over the uses of the net
proceeds in this offering and investors will be relying on the judgment of our
management regarding the application of the net proceeds. In addition, it is
possible that the amount set forth above will not be sufficient for the purposes
described above.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short or medium term investments."

this offering will be approximately $63.4 million, or $73.4 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares, based
on the initial public offering price of $13.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
received by us in this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $22 million to advance DTX101 as a treatment for hemophilia B
  through a Phase I/II clinical trial;

• approximately $22 million to advance DTX301 as a treatment for OTC deficiency
  through IND-enabling studies and into a Phase I/II clinical trial;

• approximately $12 million to advance DTX401 as a treatment for GSDIa through
  IND-enabling studies and into a Phase I/II clinical trial;

• approximately $9 million to expand our internal process development
  capabilities;

• approximately $5 million to continue to advance and to expand our research and
  development pipeline of our product candidates and other indications; and

• use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  which will include funding for the hiring of additional personnel, capital
  expenditures and the costs of operating as a public company.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay our
secured borrowings under a loan and security agreement with SVB, under which we
owed $1.6 million in principal and accrued interest as of June 30, 2015.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash
and cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon
the completion of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on
the uses set forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and
the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous
factors, including the progress of our development efforts, the status of and
results from non-clinical studies or clinical trials we may commence in the
future, as well as any collaborations that we may enter into with third parties
for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments, which include corporate,
financial institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations."

this offering and advisory fees of approximately $9.13 million payable by us, we
expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $38.87
million, or approximately $45.57 million if the underwriters' option to purchase
additional shares is exercised in full, based on the initial public offering
price of $8.00 per share. Net proceeds from this offering do not reflect that
the underwriters will not receive any underwriting discount on shares of our
common stock sold, if any, to our executive officers and founders (or their
affiliates) pursuant to any indications of interest.

We intend to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to our operating
partnership in exchange for Common Units, and our operating partnership intends
to use the net proceeds from this offering (i) to pay down $25.0 million of our
revolving credit facilities, (ii) for general corporate and working capital
purposes, including to fund capital expenditures for our existing farms
currently expected to total approximately $7.5 million for 2015, of which
$2.4 million had not yet been expended through June 30, 2015. To the extent we
receive less net proceeds from this offering, our operating partnership will use
a correspondingly lower amount of net proceeds for general corporate and working
capital purposes. To the extent we receive additional net proceeds from this
offering, our operating partnership will pay down a correspondingly higher
amount of outstanding debt under our revolving credit facilities.

As of the date of this prospectus, we had drawn down an aggregate of
approximately $52.2 million under the revolving credit facilities. The original
revolving credit facility of $25 million matures on January 1, 2019 and bears
interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of
the loan amount minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan of
the prior three (3) month period for unused amounts and (ii) for amounts drawn
upon, the 90 days London Interbank Offer Rate, or LIBOR, plus 130 basis points
(1.3%), and as of June 30, 2015, the original revolving credit facility had an
effective annual interest rate on the amount drawn upon of approximately 1.6%.
We make quarterly interest payments pursuant to the original revolving credit
facility on April 1, July 1, October 1 and January 1 of each calendar quarter.
The outstanding borrowings on the original revolving credit facility as of
June 30, 2015 of $24.25 million were primarily used to fund the acquisitions of
Falcon Farms on November 14, 2014 for approximately $8.0 million and the second
parcel of Kimberly Vineyard on December 9, 2014 for approximately $9.8 million,
with the remainder used for general corporate purposes including development
costs. The second revolving credit facility of $25 million matures on January 1,
2020 and bears interest at a rate per annum equal to (i) one quarter of one
percent (0.25%) of the loan amount minus the average outstanding principal
balance of the loan of the prior three (3) month period for unused amounts and
(ii) for amounts drawn upon, the 90 days LIBOR, plus 130 basis points (1.3%),
and as of June 30, 2015, the second revolving credit facility had an effective
annual interest rate of approximately 1.6%. We make quarterly interest payments
pursuant to the second revolving credit facility on April 1, July 1, October 1
and January 1 of each calendar quarter. As of the date of this prospectus, the
outstanding borrowings on the second revolving credit facility of $25 million
were primarily used to fund the acquisitions of the second parcel of Golden
Eagle Ranch and the Kingfisher Ranch property. The third revolving credit
facility of $25 million matures on August 1, 2020 and bears interest at a rate
per annum equal to (i) one quarter of one percent (0.25%) of the loan amount
minus the average outstanding principal balance of the loan of the prior
three (3) month period for unused amounts and (ii) for amounts drawn upon, the
90 day LIBOR, plus 130 basis points (1.3%). We make quarterly interest payments
pursuant to the third revolving credit facility on April 1, July 1, October 1
and January 1 of each calendar year. As of the date of this prospectus, the
outstanding borrowings on the third revolving credit facility of $2.2 million
were used to fund the acquisitions of the second parcel of Golden Eagle Ranch
and the Kingfisher Ranch property. If we are successful in acquiring a portfolio
of properties, although we intend to maintain leverage consistent with our
previously stated leverage range, our leverage may increase significantly over a
shorter period of time than if we acquire properties on a farm by farm basis."

$19.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 
additional ordinary shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds from this
offering will be approximately $22.7 million.

As of June 30, 2015, we had cash and cash equivalents of $54.4 million. We 
intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and
cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $5.0 million to fund external research and development expenses,
  including those related to continuation of our ongoing Phase 3 clinical trial,
  for COR-003 for the treatment of endogenous Cushing's syndrome;

• approximately $5.0 million to fund external research and development expenses,
  including those related to nonclinical animal studies, clinical trial 
  manufacturing and initiation of a Phase 2 or Phase 3 clinical trial, depending
  on advice from regulatory authorities, to support future clinical development
  of COR-004 for the treatment of acromegaly;

• approximately $5.0 million to fund external research and development expenses,
  including those related to nonclinical animal studies, formulation development
  and a dose-ranging clinical trial, to support future clinical development of 
  COR-005 for the treatment of acromegaly; and

• the remainder for working capital, general and administrative expenses, 
  internal research and development expenses, and other general corporate 
  purposes, including pre-commercial activities, potential in-licenses and 
  potential acquisitions.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current 
business through the in-license or acquisition of complementary product
candidates. While we have no current agreements or commitments for any specific
in-licenses or acquisitions at this time, we may use a portion of the net
proceeds for these purposes.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date 
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on numerous 
factors, including the relative success and cost of our research, preclinical 
and clinical development programs, our ability to obtain additional financing, 
the status of and results from clinical trials, and whether regulatory 
authorities require us to perform additional clinical trials in order to obtain
regulatory approvals. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in
the application of the net proceeds of this offering, and investors will be 
relying on our judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds. In 
addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain preclinical 
activities or clinical trials if the net proceeds from this offering and our 
other sources of cash are less than expected.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current 
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure 
requirements for at least the next 12 months. We have based this estimate on 
assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our available 
capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing investments."

including the progress of our development, the status of and results from 
clinical trials for CERC-301 and CERC-501, as well as any collaborations that we 
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management has broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, 
agreements, commitments or obligations to in-license, acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete Phase 2 clinical development of CERC-301 and 
CERC-501, preclinical research for CERC-406, and identify other preclinical lead 
candidates from our COMTi platform. It is possible that we will not achieve the 
progress that we expect with respect to CERC-301 and our COMTi platform because 
the actual costs and timing of development and marketing approval are difficult 
to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the

short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and United States

equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $9.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-301;

• approximately $7.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-501;

• approximately $1.5 million to fund research and development, and to advance 
  our pipeline of preclinical lead candidates, under the COMTi platform, 
  including the selection of additional candidates and preclinical research for 
  CERC-406; and

• the remainder for working capital, general corporate purposes and potential 
  in-licensing or other acquisitions.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from 
clinical trials for CERC-301 and CERC-501, as well as any collaborations that we 
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management has broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, 
agreements, commitments or obligations to in-license, acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete Phase 2 clinical development of CERC-301 and 
CERC-501, preclinical research for CERC-406, and identify other preclinical lead 
candidates from our COMTi platform. It is possible that we will not achieve the 
progress that we expect with respect to CERC-301 and our COMTi platform because 
the actual costs and timing of development and marketing approval are difficult 
to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and United States
government securities."

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. As of June 30, 2015,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million. We plan to use the net
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $9.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-301;

• approximately $7.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-501;

• approximately $1.5 million to fund research and development, and to advance 
  our pipeline of preclinical lead candidates, under the COMTi platform, 
  including the selection of additional candidates and preclinical research for 
  CERC-406; and

• the remainder for working capital, general corporate purposes and potential 
  in-licensing or other acquisitions.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from 
clinical trials for CERC-301 and CERC-501, as well as any collaborations that we 
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management has broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, 
agreements, commitments or obligations to in-license, acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete Phase 2 clinical development of CERC-301 and 
CERC-501, preclinical research for CERC-406, and identify other preclinical lead 
candidates from our COMTi platform. It is possible that we will not achieve the 
progress that we expect with respect to CERC-301 and our COMTi platform because 
the actual costs and timing of development and marketing approval are difficult 
to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and United States
government securities."

public offering price of $6.50 per unit, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
from this offering will be approximately $24.9 million, based on the initial
public offering price of $6.50 per unit, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. As of June 30, 2015,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million. We plan to use the net
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $9.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-301;

• approximately $7.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-501;

• approximately $1.5 million to fund research and development, and to advance 
  our pipeline of preclinical lead candidates, under the COMTi platform, 
  including the selection of additional candidates and preclinical research for 
  CERC-406; and

• the remainder for working capital, general corporate purposes and potential 
  in-licensing or other acquisitions.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from 
clinical trials for CERC-301 and CERC-501, as well as any collaborations that we 
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management has broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, 
agreements, commitments or obligations to in-license, acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete Phase 2 clinical development of CERC-301 and 
CERC-501, preclinical research for CERC-406, and identify other preclinical lead 
candidates from our COMTi platform. It is possible that we will not achieve the 
progress that we expect with respect to CERC-301 and our COMTi platform because 
the actual costs and timing of development and marketing approval are difficult 
to predict and are subject to substantial risks and delays.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including 
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments and United States
government securities."

in this offering will be approximately $21.3 million, based on the initial 
public offering price of $6.50 per unit, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
from this offering will be approximately $24.9 million, based on the initial
public offering price of $6.50 per unit, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to create a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. As of June 30, 2015,
we had cash and cash equivalents of $6.1 million. We plan to use the net
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $9.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-301;

• approximately $7.0 million to fund the costs of our Phase 2 clinical
  development of CERC-501;

• approximately $1.5 million to fund research and development, and to advance 
  our pipeline of preclinical lead candidates, under the COMTi platform, 
  including the selection of additional candidates and preclinical research for 
  CERC-406; and

• the remainder for working capital, general corporate purposes and potential 
  in-licensing or other acquisitions.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions 
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the 
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of 
our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, 
including the progress of our development, the status of and results from 
clinical trials for CERC-301 and CERC-501, as well as any collaborations that we 
may enter into with third parties for our product candidates, and any unforeseen 
cash needs. As a result, our management has broad discretion over the allocation 
of the net proceeds from this offering. We have no current understandings, 
agreements, commitments or obligations to in-license, acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses, technologies, products or assets.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds from this offering and our existing 
cash and cash equivalents described above, we estimate that such funds will be 
sufficient to enable us to complete Phase 2 clinical development of CERC-301 and 
CERC-501, preclinical research for CERC-406, and identify other preclinical lead 
candidates from our COMTi platform. It is possible that we will not achieve the

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we
    borrowed from the sponsor. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of
    this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the 
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to 
    acquiring a target business, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital in an
    amount equal to $1,750,000.

(4) Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
    that may be available to us as described in this prospectus.

(5) We will pay each of our independent directors an annual retainer of $30,000
    (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing on the
    first anniversary of the closing of this offering and ending on the earlier
    of the consummation of our initial business combination and our liquidation.

A total of $52,000,000 (or $59,800,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S.
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us (net of
taxes payable) to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed below,
none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust
account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering and (ii) a
redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event
we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable
period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust, as well as the interest income that
may be released to fund our working capital requirements will be sufficient to
pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is
based on the fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target
business in connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake
in-depth due diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant
prospective acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of
intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less
than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available
to use from the trust account is minimal as a result of the current interest
rate environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on the Nasdaq
Capital Market, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of our Chairman a total of
$10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and administrative
services. Upon completion of our initial business combination or our
liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of
$90,917 and loaned to us a total of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. The advance is non-interest bearing and is payable on
demand. The loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due on the earlier of
December 31, 2015 or the closing of this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted since the 50,000 rights
included in the private units would result in the issuance of 5,000 ordinary
shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well as 50,000 warrants
to purchase 25,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein or (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate our initial business combination within 18 months following the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. In no other circumstances
will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares and public shares in connection with the
consummation of our initial business combination. Our initial shareholders have
also agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to any public shares
purchased during or after the offering in connection with the consummation of
our initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have
agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its
founder shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within
18 months from the closing of this offering. However, if our initial
shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required
time period."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    received from Leland Investments described below. These funds will be repaid
    out of the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) We have agreed to pay the underwriters deferred commissions in an amount
    equal to $0.35 per unit, or $10.5 million in the aggregate, or approximately
    $12.1 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in 
    full, from our trust account upon closing of our initial business 
    combination, as described in this prospectus. The deferred commissions will
    be released to the underwriters only on completion of an initial business 
    combination, as described in this prospectus.

(3) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    founders’ warrants.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $1,000,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these 
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific 
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsors and directors have committed that they and/or their designees will
purchase the founders’ warrants (for an aggregate purchase price of $7,750,000)
from us on a private placement basis simultaneously with the consummation of
this offering. Our sponsors and directors have also agreed that if the
over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in full or in part, they
will purchase from us at a price of $1.00 per founders’ warrant an additional
number of founders’ warrants (up to a maximum of 900,000 founders’ warrants)
necessary to maintain in the trust account an amount equal to $10.00 per unit
sold to the public in this offering. These additional founders’ warrants will be
purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The
founders’ warrants are identical to the warrants included in the units sold in
this offering, including as to exercise price, subject to certain limited
exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the proceeds we
receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account described
below.

$300,000,000, or $345,000,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the founders’ warrants,
including the deferred commissions, will be placed in a U.S.- based trust
account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer
& Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held in trust will be
invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of
Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S.
government treasury obligations, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to interest earned
on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our
franchise and income tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed
a business combination in the required time period. The proceeds held in the
trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business.

The payment to Venturehouse Group, LLC, an affiliate of Mark D. Ein, and Dryden
Capital Management, LLC, an affiliate of L. Dyson Dryden, of a monthly fee of an
aggregate of $10,000 is for general and administrative services including office
space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Venturehouse Group, LLC and Dryden Capital Management, LLC for our benefit and
is not intended to provide Messrs. Ein and Dryden with compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the D.C.
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Venturehouse Group, LLC and Dryden
Capital Management, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
initial business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our
public stockholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, the payment of
consulting or success fees and the repayment of the $200,000 loan from another
affiliate of Mr. Ein (none of which payments will be made from the proceeds of
this offering held in the trust account prior to the completion of our initial
business combination), no compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsors,
officers, directors or any of their respective affiliates, for any services they
render in order to effectuate the consummation of our initial business
combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Our board of directors will review and approve all
reimbursements and payments made to our sponsors, officers, directors or our or
their respective affiliates, with any interested director abstaining from such
review and approval. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses
reimbursable by us to such individuals; provided, however, that to the extent
such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account,
such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate an initial
business combination. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$1,000,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our 
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by our sponsors, officers and directors in connection with activities on our 
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is
used in whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the
proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any
other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance the
operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a
variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’
operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and
development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and the up to $100,000 of interest earned on the funds held in the trust account
that we are permitted to withdraw to pay such expenses.

As of the date of this prospectus, Leland Investments Inc., an entity controlled
by Mark D. Ein, has loaned us an aggregate of $200,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq
listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan
will be payable without interest on the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us for payment
of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsors, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into warrants at a price of $1.00 per warrant. The
warrants would be identical to the founders’ warrants. If we do not complete a
business combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares in connection with a business combination which
we consummate or (iii) we seek to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholder’s rights or
pre-business combination activity prior to a business combination. This
redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any such amendment
to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether proposed by
our sponsors, any executive officer, director or director nominee, or any other
person. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or
interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $137.5 million, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase 
additional shares, the selling stockholders expect to receive net proceeds of
approximately $21.4 million (of which $18.0 million would be received by the
Tricor Funds), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
offering expenses payable by the selling stockholders. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares from the selling
stockholders, we will not receive any proceeds from such sale.

We intend to use approximately $11.8 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering to redeem the remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock,
approximately $13.3 million of the net proceeds to terminate our phantom stock
plan and to satisfy all liabilities due thereunder and the remainder of the net
proceeds to repay outstanding indebtedness under our New Term Loan Facility
incurred in connection with the Partial Preferred Redemption. As of August 17,
2015, an aggregate of approximately $435.0 million of borrowings were 
outstanding under our New Term Loan Facility. The interest rate on the
$435.0 million of borrowings outstanding under our New Term Loan Facility at
August 17, 2015 was 5.5%. Our New Term Loan Facility matures on August 17, 2022.
Borrowings under our New Credit Facility have been used to fund the Partial
Preferred Redemption and to repay indebtedness under our previously outstanding
term loan facility, and we expect to use our New Credit Facility in the future
to fund capital expenditures, for acquisition activity and for general corporate
purposes.

Redeeming the remaining outstanding shares of our preferred stock, terminating
our phantom stock plan and repaying outstanding borrowings under our New Term
Loan Facility will achieve the objective of optimizing our capital structure in
connection with the offering. Subject to the use of the net proceeds described 
herein, we may use any remaining net proceeds for general corporate and working
capital purposes."

will be approximately $71.2 million, based upon the initial public offering
price of $12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full, we estimate that we
will receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately $82.4 million,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

This offering is intended to provide funding through first-in-human studies of
our two lead programs. In particular, we currently expect to use the net
proceeds from this offering as follows:

• approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million for the development of CX-072, 
  including our planned Phase 1 clinical trials and product candidate 
  manufacturing; 

• approximately $15.0 million to $20.0 million for the development of our 
  Probody therapeutic directed against CD-166, including our planned Phase 1 
  clinical trials and product candidate manufacturing; and 

• approximately $25.0 million to $35.0 million for research and development 
  activities, including discovery of additional cancer immunotherapies and 
  first-in-class therapeutics directed against difficult-to-drug targets and 
  continued development of our Probody technology platform.

We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and other general corporate purposes, which may include funding
for the hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and the costs of
operating as a public company.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We believe the
net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash, cash
equivalents and short-term investments, will be sufficient to fund our
operations through at least 2018, including through data read out of our planned
Phase 1 clinical trials of CX-072 and our CD-166 Probody therapeutics. However,
the amounts and timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors,
including the progress of our preclinical development efforts, the results of
any clinical trials and other studies, our operating costs and expenditures and
other factors described under “Risk Factors” included elsewhere in this
prospectus. The costs and timing of developing our CX-072 and CD-166 product
candidates are highly uncertain, are subject to substantial risks and may
change. As such, we may alter the allocation of the use of the net proceeds of
this offering as a result of contingencies such as the failure of one of these
product candidates in clinical development, the identification of a more
promising product candidate in our research efforts or unexpected operating
costs and expenditures. For example, if CX-072 or our Probody therapeutics
directed against CD-166 were to fail in preclinical or clinical testing, we
would use the net proceeds that were allocated to the failed program(s) to
advance one or more of our earlier stage programs through preclinical testing
and clinical trials, in particular our T-cell recruiting bispecific antibodies
program and/or our PD-1 program, or perform further research and development
activities to identify and develop new therapeutics directed against difficult
to drug targets. Further, if in the course of our research and development
activities we identify a promising new product candidate, we may choose to
reallocate a portion of the net proceeds initially allocated to research and
development activities to the development of the new product candidate.

Pending the use of the proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities,
certificates of deposit or government securities."

shares in full, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $57.2 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering, in part, to repay
$28.1 million of outstanding indebtedness under a revolving credit facility,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, which outstanding indebtedness was $28.1
million as of June 30, 2015. On December 22, 2014, we entered into a $30.0
million revolving credit facility to refinance our existing term loan and for
certain costs related to the acquisition of F&M Bancshares and to repay
approximately $18.0 million of debt owed by F&M Bancshares to certain of its
shareholders. Our revolving credit facility matures in December 2021 and our
borrowings bear interest at the Prime Rate minus 25 basis points per annum,
which equated to approximately 3.00% at June 30, 2015. 

We plan to use any remaining net proceeds to us from this offering to support
our long-term growth by enhancing our capital ratios to permit growth
initiatives and future strategic acquisitions and for general working capital
and other corporate expenses. At any given time, we may be evaluating and
conducting due diligence with respect to potential acquisition candidates. We
cannot assure you that we will enter into any definitive agreements in respect
of any such potential transactions. Other than net proceeds used to repay a
portion of our revolving credit facility, we have not specifically allocated the
amount of net proceeds to us that will be used for these purposes, and our
management will have broad discretion over how these proceeds are used."

of our common stock in this offering will be $48.9 million, or $56.5 million if
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

. approximately $22.0 million to complete our three planned Phase 3 clinical
  trials and seek regulatory approval of A-101 for the treatment of SK;

. approximately $13.0 million to fund continued research and development of
  A-101 for the treatment of common warts, including the completion of our
  planned Phase 2 clinical trials for this indication; and

. the remainder to fund other research and development activities, including the
  development of A-102 for the treatment of SK and common warts and the
  development of A-201 and A-301 for the treatment of AA, as well as for working
  capital and other general corporate purposes, including to pursue our strategy
  to in-license or acquire additional drug candidates, although we have no
  agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses as of
  the date of this prospectus.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our drug
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of those net proceeds. The timing
and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including
cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business. Pending
these uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States.

We believe that the anticipated net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient to enable us to fund
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the
next 24 months, including the completion of our three planned Phase 3 clinical
trials for A-101 for the treatment of SK, the submission of our NDA to the FDA
for the approval of A-101 for the treatment of SK in the United States and the
completion of our planned Phase 2 clinical trials of A-101 for the treatment of
common warts. We have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be
incorrect, and we could use our available capital resources sooner than we
currently expect."

below and our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $52.0-$62.0 million to fund clinical development expenses for 
  our lead program, MRX34, which includes

• approximately $13.0-$16.0 million to complete the Phase 1 clinical trial, 
  including expansion cohorts on multiple indications and/or changes in

this offering in a private placement approximately $16.8 million of our common
stock at a price per share equal to the initial public offering price. Our
proceeds from the sale of the common stock sold in the concurrent private

predict the stage of development we expect the net proceeds of this offering to
enable us to achieve for our clinical studies and product candidates. We have no
current agreements, commitments or understandings for any material acquisitions

next 12 months.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent
private placement, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety of capital
preservation investments, including short-term, investment-grade,

(1) Approximately $165,000 of the offering expenses, including the SEC
    registration fee, the FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the
    Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid
    from the funds we borrowed from B. Luke Weil described below. These funds
    will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us. If we
    determine not to proceed with the offering, such amounts would not be
    repaid.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private rights.

(3) The funds held in the trust account will be used to acquire a target
    business, to pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares for a
    portion of the funds held in the trust account and potentially to pay our
    expenses relating thereto, including a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal
    to 4.0% of the gross proceeds raised in this offering upon consummation of
    our initial business combination for assisting us in connection with our
    initial business combination. Our expenses relating to the acquisition of a
    target business would either come from the funds held in the trust account
    or additional funds otherwise available to us outside of the trust account,
    including cash held by the target business. Any remaining funds will be
    disbursed to the combined company and be used as working capital to finance
    the operations of the target business.

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $750,000
    even if the over-allotment is exercised. In addition, interest income
    earned on the amounts held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed
    on such interest income) will be available to us to pay for our working
    capital requirements. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
    will be approximately $35,525 over a 21-month period assuming an interest
    rate of approximately 0.05% per year.

(5) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our initial shareholders and EarlyBirdCapital have agreed that they and their
respective designees will purchase an aggregate of 310,000 private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit ($3,100,000 in the aggregate) in a private placement
that will occur simultaneously with the closing of this offering. They have
further agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the
underwriters, they will purchase from us at a price of $10.00 per unit an
additional number of private units (up to a maximum of 28,500 private units) pro
rata with the amount of the over-allotment option exercised so that at least
$10.15 per share sold to the public in this offering is held in trust regardless
of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full or part. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$40,600,000, or $46,690,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private rights will be
placed in an account at UBS Financial Services in the United States, maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Pursuant to the investment management trust agreement that will govern the
investment of such funds, the trustee, upon our written instructions, will
direct UBS Financial Services to invest the funds as set forth in such written
instructions and to custody the funds while invested and until otherwise
instructed in accordance with the investment management trust agreement. The
funds held in trust will be invested only in United States government treasury
bills, bonds or notes having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting the applicable conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest solely in United States
government treasuries, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company
under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to (i) interest earned on
the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our income
or other tax obligations and (ii) any remaining interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account that may be released to us for our working capital
requirements, the proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

Other than the payment of consulting fees to our officers, directors,
shareholders or their affiliates for assisting us in consummating our initial
business combination in an amount not to exceed an aggregate of $500,000, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, shareholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type
of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on
our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business
due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$750,000, of which $250,000 will be paid by us on closing of this offering to B.
Riley & Co. as described herein. In addition, the interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account (after payment of taxes owed on such interest income)
may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements in searching for
a business combination. We intend to use the excess working capital available
for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees to consultants to assist us with
our search for a target business and for director and officer liability
insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the event due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating
business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial shareholders, officers and
directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
will also be entitled to have interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account released to us to pay any tax obligations that we may owe. We intend to
use the after-tax interest earned for miscellaneous expenses such as paying fees
to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business and for
director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held
in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well
as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
shareholders, officers and directors in connection with activities on our behalf
as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use a substantial portion of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business, to
pay holders who wish to convert or sell their shares to us for a portion of the
funds held in the trust account and to pay our expenses relating thereto,
including a fee payable to B. Riley & Co. of $250,000 upon consummation of this
offering to provide us with certain advisory services in connection with our
initial business combination and a fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital equal to 4.0%
of the gross proceeds raised in this offering (exclusive of any applicable
finders’ fees which might become payable) upon consummation of our initial
business combination for assisting us in connection with our initial business
combination, as described under the section titled “Underwriting — Business
Combination Marketing Agreement.” If the payment of our liabilities, including
the fee payable to EarlyBirdCapital, were to reduce the amount available to us
in trust necessary to pay all holders who wish to convert or sell their shares
to us for a portion of the funds held in the trust account, we would not be able
to consummate such transaction. To the extent that our share capital is used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds
held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business
combination, to pay holders who wish to convert their shares into a portion of
the funds held in the trust account or pay our expenses relating thereto (which
could include the up to $1,840,000 payable to EarlyBirdCapital described above
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be disbursed to the
combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not expended, be
used as working capital to finance the operations of the target business. Such
working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or
expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for
marketing, research and development of existing or new products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidating our trust account from our remaining assets outside of
the trust account. If such funds are insufficient, B. Luke Weil has agreed to
advance us the funds necessary to complete such liquidation (currently
anticipated to be no more than $15,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of
such expenses.

As of August 21, 2015, B. Luke Weil had advanced to us an aggregate of $30,000
to be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for a portion of the legal expenses. The advances are payable
without interest on the date on which we consummate our initial public offering.
The advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering available to us
for payment of offering expenses. If we determine not to proceed with the
offering, such amounts would not be repaid.

In order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this
offering until completion of an initial business combination, our initial
shareholders, officers and directors or their affiliates may, but are not
obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever
amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. The notes would either be
paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private units at a
price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being
issued 57,142 ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted as the
rights included in the units would result in an additional 7,142 shares being
issued, as well as 50,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 shares). Our shareholders
have approved the issuance of the units and underlying securities upon
conversion of such notes, to the extent the holder wishes to so convert them at
the time of the consummation of our initial business combination. If we do not
complete our initial business combination, the loans would not be repaid.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
liquidation if we have not completed a business combination within the required
time period or (ii) if that public shareholder converts such public shares or
sells them to us in a tender offer in each case in connection with a business
combination which we consummate or in connection with an amendment to our
memorandum and articles of association prior to the consummation of an initial
business combination. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."
DULUTH HOLDINGS INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/duluth-holdings-inc-976572-79529,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/duluth-holdings-inc-976572-79529,424B4,11/20/2015,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11026101,"We estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of our Class B common
stock in this offering will be approximately $72.5 million, or approximately
$83.7 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares in full, based on the initial public offering price of $12.00 per share,
and after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and offering expenses.

We intend to make a final distribution to shareholders who were shareholders
immediately prior to this offering, including some of our directors and
officers, relating to the termination of our “S” corporation status in an amount
equal to 100% of our cumulative undistributed taxable income from the date of
our formation through November 25, 2015, which we currently estimate to be
$51.1 million. The final “S” corporation distribution will include an amount of
income based on our expected results of operations for the full 2015 calendar
year, which is our 2015 tax year, prorated from January 1, 2015 through the date
of our conversion to a “C” corporation, unless otherwise required by law. This
prorated amount may be increased based on our actual results of operations for
the 2015 calendar year. We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay borrowings under a short-term note in the aggregate principal
amount of $46.3 million which we intend to use to fund part of this final
distribution. The short-term note will bear interest at the one month London
Interbank Offered Rate, plus 1.25% per annum, which was 1.45% of the date of 
this prospectus, and will be due and payable upon the receipt of proceeds from
this offering. We intend to fund the balance of this final distribution with our
cash on hand, our revolving line of credit or the net proceeds from this
offering. We may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to repay
borrowings under our revolving line of credit used to fund this balance, which
would be $4.8 million based on the total estimated distribution of $51.1 
million. The revolving line of credit bears interest at the same rate as the
short-term note described above and matures in July 2018.

We estimate net proceeds in excess of the final “S” corporation distribution to
be approximately $21.4 million, after deducting the underwriting discount and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use such excess proceeds
to fund growth initiatives and other general corporate purposes, including
approximately $15.0 million to $16.5 million to fund new retail store expansion
and approximately $3.5 million to $5.0 million to fund infrastructure
expenditures, including a new order management system, asset management system,
assortment planning system and e-commerce platform and office and distribution
facilities. Our expected uses of net proceeds from this offering are based on
our present plans, objectives and business condition. We have not specifically
determined the timing of these expenditures, and our management will have
discretion over when these proceeds are used. The amounts and timing of our
actual use of net proceeds will vary depending on a number of factors, including
our cash flow from operations, the number of retail stores we open as part of
our planned future retail store expansion, the timing of opening these new
retail stores, the cost and payback period of these new retail stores and the
systems, information technology and operational infrastructure necessary to
support these new retail stores. We expect it will take approximately
$2.0 million to $2.6 million in capital expenditures and starting inventory to
open a new retail store. If we open a large number of stores relatively close in
time, or if new retail stores have a higher opening cost or a longer payback
period than our existing retail stores, our cash flow from operations may not be
sufficient to support these openings and we may need to use the net proceeds
from this offering more quickly to support this growth and the continuing
operations of these new retail stores. Subject to the factors above, we may
determine to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to fund
additional systems, information technology, operational infrastructure and
facilities to support our direct business rather than investing in retail store
expansion."

$11,385,111, or approximately $13,205,064 if the underwriters exercise in full
their over-allotment option to purchase additional ADSs and warrants, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to raise additional capital, create a
U.S. public market for our ADSs and warrants, allow potential future access to
the U.S. public markets should we need more capital in the future, increase the
profile and prestige of our company with existing and possible strategic
partners and make our shares more valuable and attractive to our employees and
potential employees for compensation purposes.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

(i) approximately $1.5 million to expand our clinical development program,
    specifically with respect to the Phase III clinical trial for our leading 
    therapeutic candidate , KIT-302;                                       

(ii) approximately $1.0 million to finance the CMC activities required for   
     submitting a New Drug Application (NDA) for KIT-302 to the FDA;      

(iii) approximately $0.5 million to perform the final PK (pharmacokinetic) trial
      for the selected formulation of KIT-302;                                 

(iv) approximately $0.5 million finance our business development activities to 
     enable out-licensing of our leading therapeutic candidate, KIT-302;     
                                                                    
(v) up to approximately $0.6 million to repay the August Loans;               


(vi) approximately $1 to $3 million to expand our clinical development pipeline
     for additional drug products; and                                         

(vii) the balance of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
      working capital requirements.                                            

We believe that based on the anticipated size of this offering as set forth on
the cover page of this prospectus, the net proceeds from the offering, together
with our current cash reserves, should be sufficient to complete the Phase III
clinical trial for KIT-302, perform the final PK trial for KIT-302, and perform
the scale-up and ancillary work required to submit an NDA for KIT-302 to the
FDA.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty any or all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering, or the amounts, if any, that we will actually spend on the uses set
forth above. The amounts and timing of our actual use of the net proceeds will
vary depending on numerous factors, including the results of our Phase III
clinical trial for KIT-302, the results of the final PK trial, and our ability
to identify additional therapeutic candidates to be developed. As a result, our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds,
which may include uses not set forth above, and investors will be relying on our
judgment regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering."

research and development capabilities as well as expand our sales and marketing

investment in businesses, products, services, technologies or other assets that
we believe are complementary to our own, although we have no agreements or
understandings with respect to any acquisitions at this time.

based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty the particular uses for the net
proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the actual

variables inherent to the development of product candidates, we cannot currently
predict the stage of development we expect the net proceeds of this offering to

use the net proceeds from this offering for other purposes, and we will have
broad discretion in the application of net proceeds. Although we may use a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or licensing,
as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or businesses, we
have no current understandings, agreements or commitments to do so.

• to fund research and preclinical development of our other product candidates;
  and

• for general corporate purposes, including general and administrative expenses,
  capital expenditures, working capital and prosecution and maintenance of our 
  intellectual property. 

We believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents, along with the net
proceeds from this offering, together with interest on cash balances, will be
sufficient to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements
into 2018. The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the ongoing status of our Phase 2 clinical trials of
tipifarnib in patients who have solid tumors with HRAS mutations and in patients
with PTCL and our other planned clinical trials. Furthermore, we anticipate that
we will need to secure additional funding to complete a registrational Phase 3
clinical trial of tipifarnib, manufacturing and pre-commercialization activities
needed for potential regulatory approval and commercialization of tipifarnib,
and for development of our other product candidates.

We have not determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the items listed
above or the timing of these expenditures. Our expected use of the net proceeds
from this offering represents our current intentions based upon our present
plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our actual use of net
proceeds will vary depending on numerous factors, including the relative success
and cost of our research, preclinical and clinical development programs, whether
we are able to enter into future collaborations, and any unforeseen delays or
cash needs. As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment
regarding the application of the net proceeds of this offering. In addition, we
might decide to postpone or not pursue these current and planned trials and
activities or other development activities if the net proceeds from this
offering and the other sources of cash are less than, or do not last as long as,
expected. We have no current understandings, agreements or commitments for any
material acquisitions or licenses of any products, businesses or technologies.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government."

us, we expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $17.7 million from this
offering, or approximately $20.5 million if the over-subscription option is
exercised in full. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows
(as to such uses in China, after we complete the remittance process described
below), and we have listed the specific uses of proceeds below. If and to the
extent the over-subscription option is exercised, we intend to use any such

Approximately two-thirds of the net proceeds from this offering will be remitted
to China before we are able to use those funds to expand our business. We are
permitted under PRC laws and regulations to provide funding to Taizhou Fuling,
through capital contributions or parent/subsidiary loans, subject to approvals
from or registrations with relevant PRC government authorities. We plan to use
the capital contribution to fund Taizhou Fuling. We expect that a properly
submitted application will be approved in the ordinary course of business;
however, we cannot guarantee such an approval will occur or be timely. If our
application for a capital contribution is denied, we will use the
parent/subsidiary loan method of funding Taizhou Fuling.

As mentioned, we currently anticipate financing our subsidiaries by means of
capital contributions. We currently anticipate using a portion of the net
proceeds from this offering (total net proceeds of approximately $18 million) to
increase the registered capital of Taizhou Fuling (after which time Taizhou
Fuling may apply such funds to building a new facility in Wenling and research
and development). The increase in registered capital will require prior approval
from (i) MOFCOM to increase Taizhou Fuling’s registered capital, (ii) SAIC to
alter Taizhou Fuling’s business certificate to reflect the increase in
registered capital and (iii) SAFE to allow Taizhou Fuling’s bank to convert U.S.
dollars into RMB in order to fund such increased registered capital, or each of
the foregoing agencies’ respective local counterparts. This approval process
typically takes 30 to 90 days in total, and sometimes longer, from the time
MOFCOM or its local branches receive all the required application documents to
begin the process.

We plan to remit money to China using the capital contribution method. The
approval from MOFCOM is the key approval in the capital contribution process,
and we believe all other approvals are ministerial if MOFCOM approves such
increase in registered capital. We have not yet initiated this process but
intend to start the process immediately upon completion of the offering. We do
not foresee any problem receiving necessary government approvals for a capital
contribution; however, if our application is rejected, we would remit money to
China through a parent/subsidiary loan instead. If we were to provide funding to
Taizhou Fuling through parent/subsidiary loans (rather than the capital
contribution method), the total amount of such parent/subsidiary loans may not
exceed $8.89 million, which is the difference between Taizhou Fuling’s total
investment amount as approved by the foreign investment authorities (currently
$20 million), and Taizhou Fuling’s registered capital (currently $11.11
million). To the extent we are unable to receive all of the proceeds of this
offering through a parent/subsidiary loan, we would anticipate using such excess
in our U.S. operations, but may, at any time, reallocate those of other funds
via intercompany loans and contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. By contrast,
if we fund Taizhou Fuling through a capital contribution, the amount of our
contribution is subject to increasing our registered capital, as described
above, and applying to change the approved investment amount is not required.
Such parent/subsidiary loans must also be registered with the SAFE, which
registration usually takes no more than 20 working days after application to
complete. The cost for obtaining such approvals and completing such registration
is minimal.

We cannot assure you that we will be able to complete these government
registrations or obtain the relevant approvals on a timely basis, if at all. The
procedure to remit funds may take several months after completion of this
offering, and we will be unable to use the funds in China until remittance is
completed. We have not yet initiated the process of remitting money to China
using either method but will begin to do so promptly upon completion of this
offering.

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our Ordinary Shares. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect of the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. The occurrence of
unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in application of
the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus."

offering and the formation transactions, we expect net proceeds from this
offering of approximately $6,540,000 million, assuming completion of the minimum
offering, or $7,988,000 million, assuming completion of the maximum offering at
the initial public offering price of $4.00 per share. The net proceeds from this
offering must be remitted to China before we will be able to use the funds to
grow our business. The procedure to remit funds may take several months after
completion of this offering, and we will be unable to use the offering proceeds
in China until remittance is completed.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows after we complete
the remittance process, and we have ordered the specific uses of proceeds in
order of priority.

• Approximately $3.2 million for the purchase of equipment including
  workstations, computers and headsets;

• Approximately $1.1 million for future acquisitions;

• Approximately $700,000 for additional research and development related to data
  mining and product development; and

• The balance, approximately $1 million (assuming a minimum offering) or $2.5
  million (assuming a maximum offering for additional working capital.

The precise amounts and percentage of proceeds we would devote to particular
categories of activity will depend on prevailing market and business conditions
as well as on the nature of particular opportunities that may arise from time to
time. Similarly, the priority of our prospective uses of proceeds will depend on
business and market conditions are they develop. Accordingly, we reserve the
right to change the use of proceeds that we presently anticipate and describe
herein.

Pending remitting the offering proceeds to the PRC, we intend to invest our net
proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations."

approximately US$66.5 million, or approximately US$76.6 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, after deducting
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, as
well as net proceeds of approximately US$9.0 million from the concurrent private
placement, after deducting the placement fee payable by us.

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private
placement primarily for general corporate purposes, which may include investment
in product development, sales and marketing activities, technology
infrastructure, capital expenditures, improvement of corporate facilities and
other general and administrative matters. We may also use a portion of these
proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in, technologies, solutions or
businesses that complement our business, although we have no present commitments
or agreements to enter into any acquisitions or investments.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering and
the concurrent private placement. Our management, however, will have significant
flexibility and discretion to apply the net proceeds of this offering and the
concurrent private placement. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent
private placement differently than as described in this prospectus.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

In using the proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement, we
are permitted under PRC laws and regulations as an offshore holding company to
provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China only through
loans or capital contributions and to our consolidated variable interest entity
only through loans, subject to the approval of government authorities and limit
on the amount of capital contributions and loans. Subject to satisfaction of
applicable government registration and approval requirements, we may extend
inter-company loans to our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary in China or make
additional capital contributions to our wholly-foreign-owned subsidiary to fund
its capital expenditures or working capital. For an increase of registered
capital of our wholly foreign-owned subsidiary, we need to obtain approval from
the MOC or its local counterparts, which will decide within 90 days after
receiving the application. If we provide funding to our wholly foreign-owned
subsidiary through loans, the total amount of such loans may not exceed the
difference between the entity’s total investment as approved by the foreign
investment authorities and its registered capital. Such loans must be registered
with SAFE or its local branches, which usually takes up to 20 working days to
complete. We cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all."

million based upon the initial public offering price of $21.00 per Class A
ordinary share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of Class A ordinary shares in this offering by the
selling shareholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A ordinary
shares. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses and
capital expenditures. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire
complementary businesses, products, services or technologies. However, we do not
have agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions at this time.

We also may use certain of the net proceeds to satisfy tax withholding
obligations related to the vesting of RSUs held by current and former employees,
which will begin to vest after the completion of this offering. Based on the
initial public offering price of $21.00 per Class A ordinary share,
1,678,611 shares underlying RSUs vesting on such date and the applicable income
tax rate for certain of our employees from whom we will withhold taxes, we would
use approximately $7.9 million to satisfy these tax withholding obligations.

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds from this
offering. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds to us from the offering in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."
