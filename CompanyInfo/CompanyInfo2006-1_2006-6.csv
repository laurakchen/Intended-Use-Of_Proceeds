we are selling in this offering are expected to be approximately $20,137,500,
(or approximately $23,360,625 if the underwriter’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full), after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to execute our
growth strategy, expand our inventory by building additional wireless and
stationary player terminals and for other general corporate and working capital
purposes. We have not determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of these
uses or the timing of these expenditures. We do not have more specific plans for
any net proceeds to us from this offering. The amounts we actually expend will
vary significantly, depending on a number of factors including future revenue
growth, if any, and the amount of cash that we generate from operations. As a
result, we will retain broad discretion in the use of net proceeds of this
offering. We may seek to acquire, invest in or establish joint ventures with
respect to businesses, products, services or technologies that complement or
expand our existing business, and we may use a portion of any net proceeds for
acquisitions, investments or joint ventures. We do not, however, have any
present arrangements, understanding or agreements with respect to and we are not
currently engaged in any negotiations in furtherance of any such acquisitions,
investments or joint ventures. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering,
we intend to invest any net proceeds to us in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities or cash.

    The other purposes of this offering are to enhance our ability to acquire
other businesses, to create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate
our future access to public equity markets, to provide liquidity for our
existing stockholders, to improve the effectiveness of our stock option plans in
attracting and retaining key employees, to increase the visibility of our
company in a marketplace in which several of our competitors are publicly-held
companies, and to provide our customers greater assurances as to our long-term
viability, which is enhanced by being subject to the financial reporting and
disclosure obligations of a public company."

approximately $171.3 million, or $198.8 million if the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option in full, based on an initial public offering price
of $18.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and our estimated fees and expenses, including the fee to be paid to affiliates
of BRS in connection with the termination of the management services agreement
described under ""Related Party Transactions—Management Agreement and Transaction
Fees."" We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

                                                                            Amount

•    Fund the purchase price and related costs and expenses of the       $        57.7
     Eagle acquisition                                                        
•    Purchase rental equipment currently under operating leases          $        35.0
•    Pay deferred compensation owed to one of our current executives     $         8.3
     and a former executive                                                   
•    Repay, with the remaining net proceeds, a portion of the            $        70.3
     borrowings under our senior secured credit facility                      


    The amount of net proceeds allocated to each of the uses identified above
are based upon amounts necessary to fund such uses at September 30, 2005 (except
in the case of the Eagle acquisition, which is based upon Eagle's unaudited
November 30, 2005 results). The actual amounts of the net proceeds that we will
use to fund the Eagle acquisition, purchase rental equipment currently under
operating leases and pay deferred compensation will differ from the amounts set
forth above based on the then current amounts required for each at the time this
offering is completed. In addition, the amount of borrowings that we will
actually repay under our senior secured credit facility will depend upon the
amount of net proceeds remaining after application to the other uses. We may use
a portion of the net proceeds allocated to repay borrowings under our senior
secured credit facility for general corporate purposes.

    At November 30, 2005, the amount required to purchase rental equipment
currently under operating leases was approximately $33.0 million and the amount
required to pay deferred compensation owed to one our current executives and a
former executive was approximately $8.4 million.

    If we do not consummate the Eagle acquisition, we intend instead to use such
portion of the net proceeds for general corporate purposes. Pending application
of the net proceeds for the uses described above, we may repay additional
borrowings under our senior secured credit facility or invest in money market
accounts or other short-term interest bearing instruments.

    Senior Secured Credit Facility.  As of September 30, 2005, the total balance
outstanding on our senior secured credit facility was $81.2 million, with
$40.8 million available in additional borrowings, net of $28.0 million in
standby letters of credit. At November 30, 2005, outstanding indebtedness under
our senior secured credit facility was approximately $100.8 million, with
$56.3 million available in additional borrowings, net of $7.9 million in standby
letters of credit. The senior secured credit facility bears interest at either
(1) the Index Rate (the higher of the prime rate, as determined pursuant to the
amended credit agreement, and the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points) plus
the applicable revolver Index margin per annum based on the daily excess
availability (7.00% at September 30, 2005) or (2) the applicable London
Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR rate, plus the applicable revolver LIBOR margin
per each calendar month based on the daily excess availability (6.16% at
September 30, 2005). The senior secured credit facility matures on February 10,
2009. An affiliate of Banc of America Securities LLC, an underwriter in this
offering, is a lender under our senior secured credit facility and will receive
approximately 37% of the $70.3 million net offering proceeds that will be used
to repay a portion of the borrowings under our senior secured credit facility. 
This amount is proportional to the lender's outstanding loan amount under our 
senior secured credit facility. 

    Eagle Acquisition.  On January 4, 2006, we entered into an agreement to
acquire all of the capital stock of Eagle High Reach Equipment, Inc. and all of
the equity interests of its subsidiary, Eagle High Reach Equipment, LLC
(together, ""Eagle"") for a formula-based purchase price to be determined (which,
based on Eagle's unaudited November 30, 2005 financial results, is currently
estimated to be approximately $57.2 million), subject to adjustment, plus
assumed indebtedness of approximately $2.0 million. The actual purchase price
may be higher or lower, depending upon Eagle's actual financial results through
the end of the month immediately preceding the closing of the acquisition. Eagle
High Reach Equipment, Inc. holds a 50% ownership interest in its subsidiary,
Eagle High Reach Equipment, LLC, and SBN Eagle LLC holds the remaining 50%.
Because in the proposed acquisition we would acquire the ownership interests
held by each party, the purchase price would be divided equally between them.
Our proposed acquisition of Eagle is subject to the receipt of financing and the
satisfaction of customary closing conditions. In addition, the acquisition
agreement is subject to termination by either party under certain circumstances
if the closing has not occurred on or before February 28, 2006. We have made a
$2.0 million cash deposit into escrow against payment of the purchase price. If
the acquisition agreement terminates due to our failure to complete this
offering or obtain alternative financing (except under certain circumstances),
or if Eagle elects to terminate the acquisition agreement because we are in
material breach of our obligations under the acquisition agreement, Eagle will
be entitled to retain this $2.0 million deposit. Gary W. Bagley, our Chairman,
serves as the Chief Executive Officer and a manager of Eagle High Reach
Equipment, LLC and also serves as the interim Chief Executive Officer and a
director of Eagle High Reach Equipment, Inc. Kenneth R. Sharp, Jr., one of our
executives, serves as a director of Eagle High Reach Equipment, Inc. In
addition, Mr. Bagley and Mr. Sharp hold approximately 25.3% and 6.0%,
respectively, of the ownership interests in Eagle High Reach Equipment, Inc. and
would receive approximately $4.3 million and $1.0 million, respectively, from
the proceeds of this offering in connection with the potential acquisition."

sale of 13,750,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
underwriting discounts, fees and commissions but before paying estimated
offering expenses. Approximately $48.0 million of the net proceeds will be used
to replenish our working capital as described below. We anticipate using the
aggregate net proceeds of this offering:

   •  To replenish all, or approximately $48.0 million, of the working capital, or
      18.7% of net proceeds, $37.0 million of which will be used to repay working 
      capital borrowings under the revolving portion of our second amended and    
      restated credit facility, that will be distributed to the HMTF Investors by 
      Regency Gas Services LLC immediately prior to consummation of this offering 
      and the formation transactions;                                             
  
   •  to distribute approximately $197.0 million, or 76.6% of net proceeds, to the
      HMTF Investors for reimbursement of capital expenditures comprising most of 
      the initial investment by the HMTF Investors in Regency Gas Service LLC;    
  
   •  to pay $9.0 million, or 3.5% of net proceeds, to an affiliate of Hicks Muse 
      as consideration for the termination of ten-year financial advisory and     
      monitoring and oversight agreements between the affiliate of Hicks Muse     
      and us; and                                                                 
  
   •  to pay approximately $3.0 million, or 1.2% of net proceeds, of expenses     
      associated with the offering and related formation transactions.            

    The HMTF Investors will realize approximately $245.0 million as a result of
distributions made by us in connection with this offering, including the
$48.0 million of working capital distributed to them immediately prior to the
consummation of this offering. This represents approximately 95.3% of the net
proceeds from the offering. In addition, an affiliate of Hicks Muse will receive
$9.0 million in connection with the termination of the financial advisory and
monitoring and oversight agreements with us.

    Borrowings being repaid under the revolving portion of our second amended
and restated credit facility were incurred temporarily to finance working
capital. The revolving portion of our second amended and restated credit
facility has an annual interest rate of 8.5% and matures on June 1, 2010.
Affiliates of UBS Securities LLC, Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and KeyBanc
Capital Markets, a Division of McDonald Investments Inc., are lenders under our
second amended and restated credit facility.

    The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units will be used to redeem an equal number of common units
from the HMTF Investors."

approximately $15.7 million, at the initial public offering price of $7.50 per
share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions payable by us,
the non-accountable expense allowance payable to the underwriters and our other
estimated offering costs. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
ordinary shares by the selling shareholders pursuant to the underwriters’
exercise of the over-allotment option.

We intend to apply the net proceeds of this offering to research and development
activities, to expand our sales and marketing operations, including through the
establishment of a U.S.-based office, to enhance our business development
capabilities, including funding the costs of any original equipment
manufacturing agreements that we may enter into in the future, and for general
corporate purposes. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to fund
possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products
and technologies. We have no current agreements or commitments with respect to
any investment or acquisition, and we are not engaged in negotiations with
respect to any investment or acquisition.

We have not yet determined the final use of the net proceeds of this offering.
Our current estimate of the use of the net proceeds from this offering is as

——————

(1) Our research and development activities currently include product development
for IncrediDesktop and IncrediPhoto and other products and services as further
described under “Business – Research and Development.”

(2) We expect to apply a portion of the proceeds from this offering to implement our
marketing strategies, including offline and online advertising and public
relations events as further described under “Business – Sales, Marketing and
Distribution.”

(3) We expect that the costs associated with establishing a U.S. office will include
rent, furnishings and hiring personnel to staff the office.  See “Business –
Sales, Marketing and Distribution” for additional discussion of our proposed
U.S. office.

(4) We expect to apply a portion of proceeds of this offering to further expand our
sales and business development personnel and to pay for the costs of entering
into OEM agreements and other strategic sales arrangements.  

(5) In addition to the necessary working capital to support our growth, we expect to
apply a portion of the proceeds from this offering for general and
administrative costs associated with our business and anticipated growth,
including establishing our accounting and finance department and other costs
associated with being a public company (see “Risk Factors – If we do not
establish a fully-staffed accounting and financial department, our business and
our share price could be adversely affected”). We may also explore potential
acquisitions of complementary companies or assets, although we do not currently
have any specific acquisition candidates.

The amount and timing of what we actually spend for these purposes may vary
significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future
revenues and cash generated by operations, our expenditures, potential changes
in strategy and the other factors we describe in “Risk Factors.” We may find it
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for
other purposes. Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of
proceeds include:

†  the existence of presently unknown strategic opportunities or the need to take
advantage of changes in timing of our existing research, development and/or
commercial activities; and/or

†  the need or desire on our part to accelerate, increase or eliminate existing
initiatives due to, among other things, changing market conditions and
competitive developments.

From time to time, we evaluate these and other factors and we anticipate
continuing to make such evaluations to determine if our existing allocation of
resources, including the proceeds of this offering, is being optimized.
Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net proceeds to
us from this offering. Pending their ultimate use, we intend to invest the net
proceeds to us from this offering primarily in investment grade,
interest-bearing instruments."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from advances we received  
    from Messrs. Hughes and Lewis described below. These advances will be repaid 
    out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon          
    consummation of this offering.                                               

(2) Due diligence expenses and legal, accounting and non-due diligence expenses  
    are expected to total $700,000 and $500,000, respectively. The difference    
    between these amounts and the budgeted allocations from amounts not held in  
    trust will be funded from interest income, net of income taxes payable, of up
    to $750,000 released to us from the trust account. Any such interest income  
    not used for due diligence or legal, accounting and non-due diligence        
    expenses will be usable by us to pay other expenses that may exceed our      
    current estimates.                                                           

A total of approximately $98.4 million or approximately $113.1 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds
will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Except for interest income released to us, net of income taxes, the proceeds
held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in
the trust account that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest
income, net of income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business
combination with one or more target businesses which have a fair market value of
at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $3.6 million or
approximately $4.1 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) at
the time of such business combination, subject to a majority of our public
stockholders voting in favor of the business combination and less than 20% of
the public stockholders electing their conversion rights. Following release from
the trust account of interest income, net of income taxes, on the trust account
balance that we may use for working capital requirements and after payment of
the conversion price to any public stockholders who exercise their conversion
rights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to
pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with
which our initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for
using stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the
trust account to general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of acquired business, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies in the food and beverage
industries, or for working capital.

We have estimated the expenses related to identification, negotiating and
structuring an initial business combination at approximately $1.2 million,
including approximately $700,000 for due diligence, market research and
reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs, and $500,000 for legal, accounting and
other non-due diligence expenses. Interest income, net of income taxes payable,
of up to $750,000 on the balance in the trust account will be released to us to
fund our working capital requirements. These funds will be used to pay due
diligence and legal, accounting and other non-due diligence expenses exceeding
the $600,000 allocated to such purposes from proceeds not held in trust and to
pay other expenses that exceed our current estimates.

In contrast to many other companies with business plans similar to ours that
must combine with one or more target businesses that have a fair market value
equal to 80% or more of the acquiror’s net assets, we will not combine with a
target business or businesses unless the fair market value of such entity or
entities meets a minimum valuation threshold of 80% of the amount in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of
approximately $3.6 million or approximately $4.1 million if the over-allotment
option is exercised in full). We have used this criterion to provide investors
and our management team with greater certainty as to the fair market value that
a target business or businesses must have in order to qualify for a business
combination with us. The determination of net assets requires an acquiror to
have deducted all liabilities from total assets to arrive at the balance of net
assets. Given the on-going nature of legal, accounting, stockholder meeting and
other expenses that will be incurred immediately before and at the time of a
business combination, the balance of an acquiror’s total liabilities may be
difficult to ascertain at a particular point in time with a high degree of
certainty. Accordingly, we have determined to use the valuation threshold of 80%
of the amount in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions of approximately $3.6 million or approximately $4.1 million if
the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for the fair market value of the
target business or businesses with which we combine so that our management team
will have greater certainty when selecting, and our investors will have greater
certainty when voting to approve or disapprove a proposed combination with, a
target business or businesses that will meet the minimum valuation criterion for
our initial business combination.

We have agreed to pay Hughes Consulting, Inc. and Jeltex Holdings, LLC, entities
controlled by Messrs. Hughes and Lewis, respectively, a combined total of
$10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial
support. Mr. Hughes is our chief executive officer and a director, and Mr. Lewis
is one of our directors. This arrangement is being agreed to by Hughes
Consulting, Inc. and Jeltex Holdings, LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Messrs. Hughes and Lewis compensation in lieu of a salary or other
remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by Hughes
Consulting, Inc. and Jeltex Holdings, LLC will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We intend to use the excess working capital to pay director and officer
liability insurance premiums of approximately $340,000, with the balance of
approximately $20,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates. We expect that due diligence of prospective
target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors
and may include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants.
Our officers, directors and initial stockholders, or their affiliates or
associates, will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of
prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities. We have agreed with the representatives that our audit
committee will review and approve all expense reimbursements made to our
officers, directors or senior advisors and that any expense reimbursements
payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our
board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from
such review and approval.

We believe that the amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the
costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on
the fact that the research previously conducted by Messrs. Hughes and Lewis
identified a number of potential target business candidates, and that in-depth
due diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our initial stockholders, but none of such
persons is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

If we complete a business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
our officers and directors prior to the business combination’s closing will
become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these
out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These
expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be
treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination,
negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target
business’s owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our
management to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in
a conflict of interest.

We had previously agreed to compensate Robert S. Gluck and his consulting firm,
Matthew Robert Associates, for assistance they were to provide to us in
identifying and negotiating with potential target businesses. However, on
November 4, 2005, Messrs. Hughes and Lewis agreed to sell to Mr. Gluck 112,596
and 187,659 shares of common stock, respectively, owned by them or an aggregate
of 300,255 shares, for a purchase price of approximately $.00784 per share. As a
stockholder, Mr. Gluck is prohibited from receiving any compensation from us
and, accordingly, we and Mr. Gluck agreed to rescind the prior consulting
agreement with him and Matthew Robert Associates on November 4, 2005. Mr. Gluck
also agreed to become a vice chairman of Boulder Specialty Brands on November 4,
2005.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, Messrs. Hughes and Lewis have advanced to us
a total of $200,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASD
registration fee, and accounting and legal fees and expenses. These advances are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of March 31, 2006 or
the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds
of this offering not being placed in trust.

It is possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in the trust account
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination. We believe the net proceeds from the
offering will be sufficient to fund the evaluation, negotiation and other
expenses attendant to consummating a business combination even if we make such a
payment. However, in the event that such deposit were large enough (thereby
depleting enough of our non-trust account assets) or in the event we were
ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of
the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a
sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the trust account to
conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to completing the business
combination or finding another suitable business combination without securing
additional financing. Although they are not obligated to do so, it is possible
that our initial stockholders could advance us the additional required funds,
thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be
reimbursed following a business combination. If we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. According
to the Federal Reserve Statistical Release dated December 12, 2005 referencing
historical interest rate data which appears on the Federal Reserve website, U.S.
Treasury Bills with four week, three month and six month maturities were
yielding as of December 9, 2005 3.54%, 3.85% and 4.13%, respectively. While we
cannot assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to yield
these rates, we believe such rates are representative of those we may receive on
the balance of the trust account. Interest income, net of income taxes payable
on such interest, of up to $750,000 on the trust account balance is releasable
to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital
requirements. Following consummation of this offering, we believe the funds
available to us outside of the trust account, together with interest income, net
of income taxes on such interest, of up to $750,000 on the balance of the trust
account to be released to us for working capital requirements, will be
sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a
business combination is not completed during that time.

Other than the $10,000 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our initial stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our initial stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that
such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account
and interest income, net of income taxes, of up to $750,000 that is released to
us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed
by us unless we consummate a business combination. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no current ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income, net of
income taxes, released to us from the trust account) only in the event of our
liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination within the allotted
time or if the public stockholder seeks to convert such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against
and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account.

On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and the trustee
must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,
the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions in the trust account, and (ii) that the
trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions to the public stockholders on a pro ratabasis."

--------
(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from advances we received  
    from Messrs. Hughes and Lewis described below. These advances will be repaid 
    out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon          
    consummation of this offering.                                               

(2) Due diligence expenses and legal, accounting and non-due diligence expenses  
    are expected to total $700,000 and $500,000, respectively. The difference    
    between these amounts and the budgeted allocations from amounts not held in  
    trust will be funded from interest income, net of income taxes payable, of up
    to $750,000 released to us from the trust account. Any such interest income  
    not used for due diligence or legal, accounting and non-due diligence        
    expenses will be usable by us to pay other expenses that may exceed our      
    current estimates.                                                           

A total of approximately $98.4 million or approximately $113.1 million if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the net proceeds
will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Except for interest income released to us, net of income taxes, the proceeds
held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of
the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in
the trust account that are not converted to cash or released to us as interest
income, net of income taxes, will be released on closing of our initial business
combination with one or more target businesses which have a fair market value of
at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $3.6 million or
approximately $4.1 million if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) at
the time of such business combination, subject to a majority of our public
stockholders voting in favor of the business combination and less than 20% of
the public stockholders electing their conversion rights. Following release from
the trust account of interest income, net of income taxes, on the trust account
balance that we may use for working capital requirements and after payment of
the conversion price to any public stockholders who exercise their conversion
rights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to
pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with
which our initial combination occurs. If the business combination is paid for
using stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the
trust account to general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of acquired business, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies in the food and beverage
industries, or for working capital.

We have estimated the expenses related to identification, negotiating and
structuring an initial business combination at approximately $1.2 million,
including approximately $700,000 for due diligence, market research and
reimbursement of out-of-pocket costs, and $500,000 for legal, accounting and
other non-due diligence expenses. Interest income, net of income taxes payable,
of up to $750,000 on the balance in the trust account will be released to us to
fund our working capital requirements. These funds will be used to pay due
diligence and legal, accounting and other non-due diligence expenses exceeding
the $600,000 allocated to such purposes from proceeds not held in trust and to
pay other expenses that exceed our current estimates.

In contrast to many other companies with business plans similar to ours that
must combine with one or more target businesses that have a fair market value
equal to 80% or more of the acquiror’s net assets, we will not combine with a
target business or businesses unless the fair market value of such entity or
entities meets a minimum valuation threshold of 80% of the amount in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of
approximately $3.6 million or approximately $4.1 million if the over-allotment
option is exercised in full). We have used this criterion to provide investors
and our management team with greater certainty as to the fair market value that
a target business or businesses must have in order to qualify for a business
combination with us. The determination of net assets requires an acquiror to
have deducted all liabilities from total assets to arrive at the balance of net
assets. Given the on-going nature of legal, accounting, stockholder meeting and
other expenses that will be incurred immediately before and at the time of a
business combination, the balance of an acquiror’s total liabilities may be
difficult to ascertain at a particular point in time with a high degree of
certainty. Accordingly, we have determined to use the valuation threshold of 80%
of the amount in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts
and commissions of approximately $3.6 million or approximately $4.1 million if
the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for the fair market value of the
target business or businesses with which we combine so that our management team
will have greater certainty when selecting, and our investors will have greater
certainty when voting to approve or disapprove a proposed combination with, a
target business or businesses that will meet the minimum valuation criterion for
our initial business combination.

We have agreed to pay Hughes Consulting, Inc. and Jeltex Holdings, LLC, entities
controlled by Messrs. Hughes and Lewis, respectively, a combined total of
$10,000 per month for office space, administrative services and secretarial
support. Mr. Hughes is our chief executive officer and a director, and Mr. Lewis
is one of our directors. This arrangement is being agreed to by Hughes
Consulting, Inc. and Jeltex Holdings, LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Messrs. Hughes and Lewis compensation in lieu of a salary or other
remuneration because it is anticipated that the expenses to be paid by Hughes
Consulting, Inc. and Jeltex Holdings, LLC will approximate the monthly
reimbursement. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

We intend to use the excess working capital to pay director and officer
liability insurance premiums of approximately $340,000, with the balance of
approximately $20,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates. We expect that due diligence of prospective
target businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors
and may include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants.
Our officers, directors and initial stockholders, or their affiliates or
associates, will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of
prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities. We have agreed with the representatives that our audit
committee will review and approve all expense reimbursements made to our
officers, directors or senior advisors and that any expense reimbursements
payable to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our
board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from
such review and approval.

We believe that the amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the
costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on
the fact that the research previously conducted by Messrs. Hughes and Lewis
identified a number of potential target business candidates, and that in-depth
due diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a
letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a
business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking
in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from our initial stockholders, but none of such
persons is under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

If we complete a business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
our officers and directors prior to the business combination’s closing will
become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these
out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These
expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be
treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined
business. Our officers and directors may, as part of any such combination,
negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target
business’s owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our
management to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in
a conflict of interest.

We had previously agreed to compensate Robert S. Gluck and his consulting firm,
Matthew Robert Associates, for assistance they were to provide to us in
identifying and negotiating with potential target businesses. However, on
November 4, 2005, Messrs. Hughes and Lewis agreed to sell to Mr. Gluck 112,596
and 187,659 shares of common stock, respectively, owned by them or an aggregate
of 300,255 shares, for a purchase price of approximately $.00784 per share. As a
stockholder, Mr. Gluck is prohibited from receiving any compensation from us
and, accordingly, we and Mr. Gluck agreed to rescind the prior consulting
agreement with him and Matthew Robert Associates on November 4, 2005. Mr. Gluck
also agreed to become a vice chairman of Boulder Specialty Brands on November 4,
2005.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, Messrs. Hughes and Lewis have advanced to us
a total of $200,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, NASD
registration fee, and accounting and legal fees and expenses. These advances are
non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of March 31, 2006 or
the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds
of this offering not being placed in trust.

It is possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in the trust account
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination. We believe the net proceeds from the
offering will be sufficient to fund the evaluation, negotiation and other
expenses attendant to consummating a business combination even if we make such a
payment. However, in the event that such deposit were large enough (thereby
depleting enough of our non-trust account assets) or in the event we were
ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of
the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a
sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the trust account to
conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to completing the business
combination or finding another suitable business combination without securing
additional financing. Although they are not obligated to do so, it is possible
that our initial stockholders could advance us the additional required funds,
thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be
reimbursed following a business combination. If we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. According
to the Federal Reserve Statistical Release dated December 12, 2005 referencing
historical interest rate data which appears on the Federal Reserve website, U.S.
Treasury Bills with four week, three month and six month maturities were
yielding as of December 9, 2005 3.54%, 3.85% and 4.13%, respectively. While we
cannot assure you the balance of the trust account will be invested to yield
these rates, we believe such rates are representative of those we may receive on
the balance of the trust account. Interest income, net of income taxes payable
on such interest, of up to $750,000 on the trust account balance is releasable
to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital
requirements. Following consummation of this offering, we believe the funds
available to us outside of the trust account, together with interest income, net
of income taxes on such interest, of up to $750,000 on the balance of the trust
account to be released to us for working capital requirements, will be
sufficient to allow us to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming a
business combination is not completed during that time.

Other than the $10,000 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our initial stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our initial stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that
such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account
and interest income, net of income taxes, of up to $750,000 that is released to
us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed
by us unless we consummate a business combination. Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no current ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable with respect to such interest, and less interest income, net of
income taxes, released to us from the trust account) only in the event of our
liquidation if we fail to complete a business combination within the allotted
time or if the public stockholder seeks to convert such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against
and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust
account.

On completion of an initial business combination, the underwriters will receive
the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account.
If we are unable to complete an initial business combination and the trustee
must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account on our liquidation,
the underwriters have agreed (i) to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions in the trust account, and (ii) that the
trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions to the public stockholders on a pro ratabasis."

(1)  We entered into our new credit facilities in December 2005 and simultaneously
     drew down revolving and term loans thereunder, the proceeds of which were    
     used to repay all of our then outstanding indebtedness. Our new credit       
     facilities, which mature in 2010 and 2012, provide for a secured revolving   
     credit facility of up to $225.0 million, a $175.0 million first lien term    
     loan facility and a $50.0 million letter of credit facility to support crack 
     spread hedging. Borrowings under our revolving and term loan facilities bear 
     interest at a variable rate based upon LIBOR or prime rate, at our option,   
     and borrowings under our letter of credit facility to support crack spread   
     hedging bear interest at 3.5%.
    
(2)  After applying the net proceeds from this offering, we expect to have        
     $137.0 million of outstanding indebtedness, consisting of $67.0 million      
     outstanding under our first lien term loan facility and $70.0 million under  
     our secured revolving credit facility. Additionally, we will have a          
     $50.0 million letter of credit facility to support crack spread hedging. We  
     anticipate we will be able to borrow up to approximately $90.0 million in    
     additional funds under our secured revolving credit facility, based upon its 
     anticipated $200.0 million borrowing base and our anticipated $40.0 million  
     in outstanding letters of credit (other than those pursuant to our           
     $50.0 million letter of credit facility to support crack spread hedging).    

    If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, we will use the
additional net proceeds to repay additional borrowings under our term loan
facility."

class A common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of
$22.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be about $121.4 million. We will
not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholder,
including with respect to any sale of shares resulting from an exercise by the
underwriters of their option to purchase additional shares from the selling
shareholder.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from the sale of the common stock to repay
the balance outstanding under our $30 million revolving line of credit with
McDonald's, to provide additional long-term capital to support the growth of our
business (primarily through opening new stores), to continue to maintain our
existing stores and for general corporate purposes. At September 30, 2005, the
balance outstanding under our revolving line of credit was $4.6 million, and the
annual interest rate with respect to those borrowings on that date was 7.5%
(representing the U.S. prime rate on that date plus 100 basis points). This
revolving line of credit expires on June 30, 2006. We expect that it will be
terminated in connection with this offering. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our
expansion efforts, sales and marketing activities and competition. Accordingly,
our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net
proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering."

of our common stock in this offering will be approximately $95.3 million, based
upon the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full,
we estimate the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately
$109.9 million.

      We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:
     •     approximately $37 million to fund a portion of ALTU-135 development  
           activities, including a Phase III clinical trial and long-term safety
           study for the solid form of ALTU-135, a Phase II clinical trial for  
           the liquid form of ALTU-135, and related toxicology studies and      
           manufacturing and materials costs;                                   
    
     •     approximately $30 million to fund a portion of ALTU-238 development  
           activities, including a Phase III clinical trial in adults, a        
           Phase II/III clinical trial in children, and related toxicology      
           studies and manufacturing and materials costs; and                   
    
     •     the remainder to fund research and development activities for our    
           preclinical product candidates and general corporate purposes,       
           including capital expenditures and working capital.                  

      This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the
ongoing status of and results from clinical trials and other studies for
ALTU-135 and ALTU-238, as well as the development of our preclinical product
pipeline, any collaborations we may enter into with third parties for our
product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, management will
retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this
offering. We do not expect the net proceeds from this offering and our other
available funds to be sufficient to fund the completion of the development of
any of our product candidates, and we expect that we will need to raise
additional funds prior to being able to market any products. We have no current
plans, agreements or commitments for acquisitions of any businesses, products or
technologies.

      Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in accordance with our investment policy guidelines, which
currently provide for investment of funds in cash equivalents, United States
government obligations, high grade and corporate notes and commercial paper."

(1)A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee and NASD
filing fee and approximately $82,500 of legal and accounting fees, have been
paid from the funds we received from our executive officers described below.
These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
in trust upon consummation of this offering.

(2)The co-managers have agreed to deposit 4.5% of the gross proceeds of this
offering and the private placement attributable to the underwriters’ discount
and the placement fee into the trust account until the earlier of the
consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust account.
They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to, or claims against, such
proceeds unless we successfully consummate a business combination.

$26,780,000 or $30,869,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Additionally, $1,350,000 or $1,545,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount and placement fee will be deposited in the trust account.
The co-managers have agreed that such amounts will be distributed to the public
stockholders in the event of liquidation. The proceeds held in trust will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. Other than up to $600,000 of interest
income which may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements, the
proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit
of the co-managers) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other than
amounts held in trust for the benefit of the co-managers, or amounts paid for
finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in
connection with any debt or equity financing made in connection with the
business combination) may be used to finance operations of the target business.

We have estimated the costs related to the acquisition of a target business will
be approximately $900,000; approximately $500,000 to identify and research
prospective target businesses and approximately $400,000 for costs related to
the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to structure
the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the related proxy
statement. Only $375,000 of the net proceeds have been allocated for such
purposes and we intend to fund the balance, as well as amounts that may exceed
our current estimates, from a portion of the interest earned on the proceeds
being held in the trust account. Up to $600,000 of the interest earned on the
trust account (net of taxes payable) will be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements. We expect that due diligence of prospective target
businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors and
may include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our
officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence
of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capital
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as a down payment
or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the
specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as
a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise),
we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the
trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding
another suitable business combination without securing additional financing.
Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely
fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would be
forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, Ron Chaimovski, our Co-Chief Executive
Officer, and Argyle New Ventures, L.P., an entity controlled by Bob Marbut, our
other Co-Chief Executive Officer, have advanced to us a total of $155,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC and NASD registration fee, legal fees and expenses. Of
such $155,000, $62,500 was advanced to us by Mr. Chaimovski on June 23, 2005,
$62,500 was advanced to us by Argyle New Ventures L.P. on July 6, 2005, $15,000
was advanced to us by Argyle New Ventures L.P. on November 15, 2005 and $15,000
was advanced to us by Mr. Chaimovski on November 22, 2005. Such loans will be
payable with 4% annual interest on the earlier of June 30 or November 15, 2006,
or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering held in trust, and such proceeds which are not
held in the trust account and not immediately required for the purposes set
forth above, will be invested only in United States “government securities,”
defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.
Provided $600,000 of interest earned on the trust account is released to us, we
believe that we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time.

Except for an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock as would
maintain the respective ownership percentages of the existing stockholders in
the event that the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised (which may
be deemed compensation), no compensation of any kind (including any finder’s
and/or consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any
of their affiliates, from us or from any other party, for any services rendered
to us, prior to or in connection with, the consummation of the business
combination. Our existing stockholders will only be entitled to receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf. To the extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account (net
of taxes payable and interest previously released to us)) only in the event of
our liquidation as a result of our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time, or if that public stockholder were to seek to redeem
such shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

(1)A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee and NASD
filing fee and approximately $82,500 of legal and accounting fees, have been
paid from the funds we received from our executive officers described below.
These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
in trust upon consummation of this offering.

(2)The co-managers have agreed to deposit 4.5% of the gross proceeds of this
offering and the private placement attributable to the underwriters’ discount
and the placement fee into the trust account until the earlier of the
consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust account.
They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to, or claims against, such
proceeds unless we successfully consummate a business combination.

$26,780,000 or $30,869,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by
American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
Additionally, $1,350,000 or $1,545,750 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full, of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount and placement fee will be deposited in the trust account.
The co-managers have agreed that such amounts will be distributed to the public
stockholders in the event of liquidation. The proceeds held in trust will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. Other than up to $600,000 of interest
income which may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements, the
proceeds held in the trust account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit
of the co-managers) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts
not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business (other than
amounts held in trust for the benefit of the co-managers, or amounts paid for
finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in
connection with any debt or equity financing made in connection with the
business combination) may be used to finance operations of the target business.

We have estimated the costs related to the acquisition of a target business will
be approximately $900,000; approximately $500,000 to identify and research
prospective target businesses and approximately $400,000 for costs related to
the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to structure
the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the related proxy
statement. Only $375,000 of the net proceeds have been allocated for such
purposes and we intend to fund the balance, as well as amounts that may exceed
our current estimates, from a portion of the interest earned on the proceeds
being held in the trust account. Up to $600,000 of the interest earned on the
trust account (net of taxes payable) will be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements. We expect that due diligence of prospective target
businesses will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors and
may include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our
officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence
of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capital
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as a down payment
or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the
specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as
a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise),
we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the
trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding
another suitable business combination without securing additional financing.
Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely
fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would be
forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, Ron Chaimovski, our Co-Chief Executive
Officer, and Argyle New Ventures, L.P., an entity controlled by Bob Marbut, our
other Co-Chief Executive Officer, have advanced to us a total of $155,000, which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC and NASD registration fee, legal fees and expenses. Of
such $155,000, $62,500 was advanced to us by Mr. Chaimovski on June 23, 2005,
$62,500 was advanced to us by Argyle New Ventures L.P. on July 6, 2005, $15,000
was advanced to us by Argyle New Ventures L.P. on November 15, 2005 and $15,000
was advanced to us by Mr. Chaimovski on November 22, 2005. Such loans will be
payable with 4% annual interest on the earlier of June 30 or November 15, 2006,
or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering held in trust, and such proceeds which are not
held in the trust account and not immediately required for the purposes set
forth above, will be invested only in United States “government securities,”
defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United States having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule
2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.
Provided $600,000 of interest earned on the trust account is released to us, we
believe that we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time.

Except for an option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock as would

our liquidation as a result of our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time, or if that public stockholder were to seek to redeem
such shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other

        o       $11.7 million (53.19% of the net proceeds) will be contributed
                to Magyar Bank;

        o       $1.9 million (8.63% of the net proceeds) will be loaned to our
                employee stock ownership plan to fund its purchase of 8.0% of
                the shares of common stock sold in the offering and issued to
                the charitable foundation; and

        o       $8.4 million (38.18% of the net proceeds) will be retained by
                us.

        We may use the net proceeds of the stock offering to invest in
securities, to deposit funds in Magyar Bank, to finance the possible acquisition
of other financial institutions or financial service businesses, to pay
dividends or for other general corporate purposes, including repurchasing shares
of our common stock. Magyar Bank may use the proceeds it receives to make loans,
to purchase securities, to expand its banking franchise internally, through
branching or through acquisitions, and for general corporate purposes.  Neither 
Magyar Bank nor Magyar Bancorp, Inc. is considering any specific acquisition 
transaction at this time."

(1) We intend to redeem all of the outstanding shares of our new preferred stock
    and pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends on that stock immediately      
    following the completion of this offering. There are 82,055 shares of our   
    new preferred stock outstanding and, as of September 30, 2005, there were   
    $9.3 million of accumulated and unpaid dividends on those shares.           
    Immediately prior to the merger and the closing of this offering, we intend 
    to redeem our one outstanding share of mandatorily redeemable preferred     
    stock and pay all accumulated and unpaid dividends on that share with $1,770
    of available cash. All of our outstanding preferred stock is held by Carl C.
    Icahn, our principal beneficial stockholder and the chairman of our board of
    directors, and his affiliates.                                   
   
(2) Includes indebtedness owed to Arnos Corp. and ACF Industries Holding Corp., 
    both of which are beneficially owned and controlled by Mr. Icahn. On        
    December 17, 2004, we issued a note payable to Arnos Corp. in the amount of 
    $7.0 million that bears interest at the U.S. prime rate plus 1.75% and is   
    payable on demand. We refer to this note as the Arnos note. We used the     
    proceeds of the Arnos note to provide additional working capital. As of     
    September 30, 2005, the interest rate on the Arnos note was 8.5%. As of     
    September 30, 2005, we had $7.0 million in principal amount and $0.4 million
    in accrued interest on the Arnos note outstanding. As of January 1, 2005, in
    connection with our purchase of Castings LLC, the entity through which we   
    own our interest in the Ohio Castings joint venture, from ACF Industries    
    Holding Corp., we issued a note payable to ACF Industries Holding Corp. in  
    the principal amount of $12.0 million. We refer to this note as the Castings
    note. The Castings note bears interest at the U.S. prime rate plus 0.5% and 
    is due on demand. As of September 30, 2005, the interest rate on the        
    Castings note was 7.25%. As of September 30, 2005, we had $12.0 million in  
    principal amount and $0.6 million in accrued interest on the Castings note  
    outstanding. 
   
(3) The industrial revenue bonds are due at varying dates through 2011 and as of
    September 30, 2005 bear interest at rates ranging from 7.75% to 8.5%, with a
    weighted average interest rate of 8.3% per year. See “Management’s          
    discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of               
    operations—Liquidity and capital resources—Industrial revenue bonds.” The   
    industrial revenue bonds are guaranteed by affiliates of Mr. Icahn, and     
    these affiliates will be released from such guarantees upon repayment of the
    industrial revenue bonds. In addition, James J. Unger, our president and    
    chief executive officer, and his wife own $0.4 million of the industrial    
    revenue bonds issued by Paragould, Arkansas. 
 
    Amounts include accrued and unpaid interest through the date of the
    repurchase of the industrial revenue bonds. As of September 30, 2005, we had
    $8.3 million in principal amount and $0.3 million in accrued interest       
    outstanding on the industrial revenue bonds. At the closing of this         
    offering, we will deliver the aggregate principal amount outstanding under  
    the industrial revenue bonds and accrued and unpaid interest to the date of 
    redemption to the trustee under the indenture governing the industrial      
    revenue bonds and we will deliver to the trustee irrevocable instructions to
    notify the holders of the industrial revenue bonds of the redemption of all 
    outstanding industrial revenue bonds. Pursuant to the terms of the          
    indenture, the industrial revenue bonds will be redeemed upon the expiration
    of a 30-day to 60-day notice period from the date the trustee gives notice  
    to the holders of the industrial revenue bonds. At the time we deposit the  
    amounts due under the industrial revenue bonds with the trustee and give    
    irrevocable instructions to the trustee the industrial revenue bonds will be
    deemed to be repaid.                                                        
   
(4) As of September 30, 2005, we had $31.3 million in principal and interest    
    outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility. We intend to use  
    the remaining net proceeds from this offering, following the redemption of  
    our new preferred stock and the repayment of our notes due to affiliates and
    our industrial revenue bonds described above, to repay amounts outstanding  
    under our existing revolving credit facility upon the closing of this       
    offering. To the extent the remaining net proceeds from this offering,      
    following the redemption of our new preferred stock and the repayment of our
    notes due to affiliates and our industrial revenue bonds described above,   
    are insufficient to repay our existing revolving credit facility in full, we
    intend to use a portion of our available cash and cash equivalents to repay 
    additional amounts outstanding under our existing revolving credit facility 
    upon the closing of this offering. Borrowings under our existing revolving  
    credit facility bear interest at various rates based on either the LIBOR or 
    the U.S. prime rate. As of September 30, 2005, the interest rate on the     
    borrowings under the revolving credit facility was 6.5%, based on the       
    U.S. prime rate at that time. Our existing revolving credit facility matures
    in March 2006.                        
   
(5) We intend to use any remaining net proceeds from this offering, after       
    application of the net proceeds as described above, to pay additional       
    dividends accumulated on our outstanding shares of preferred stock,         
    additional interest accrued on our notes due to affiliates and industrial   
    revenue bonds, and additional amounts borrowed, if any, under our revolving 
    credit facility, in each case since September 30, 2005, and for working     
    capital and general corporate purposes.                                     
   
(6) This excludes a one-time special cash bonus of $500,000 that William P.     
    Benac, our chief financial officer, is entitled to receive on April 22, 2007
    in the event we complete this offering and provided Mr. Benac remains       
    employed with us until that date, subject to certain exceptions."

Quantum Energy Partners' ownership of units will be reduced from 10,827,015

38.9% to 32.8%.

(1)  The underwriters will not receive any discount or commission on              
     1,666,667 units offered to Kojaian Ventures, L.L.C., which will be offered   
     directly by us at a price per unit of $6.00.                                 
    
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
     from our affiliate described below. These funds will be repaid out of the    
     proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
     offering.                                                                    
    
(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer $2,300,000 of their underwriting       
     discount, equal to 2% of the gross proceeds of the 19,166,667 units being    
     offered to the public, until the consummation of a business combination. Upon
     the consummation of a business combination, such deferred discount shall be  
     released to the underwriters out of the gross proceeds of this offering held 
     in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. or Citigroup, maintained by    
     Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee. The           
     underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred    
     discount.                                                                    
    
(4)  Exclusive of the $2,500,000 initial capital contribution of our existing     
     stockholders.                                                                
    
(5)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $1,562,500  
     even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                     

   Of the net proceeds of this offering (including the units offered to Kojaian
Ventures, L.L.C.), $114,887,504, or $132,325,004 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full, plus our existing stockholders’ $2,500,000 initial capital
contribution, (accordingly, an aggregate of $117,387,504 or $134,825,004,
respectively) will be placed in a trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. or
Citigroup, maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,
New York, as trustee. In the event that the units offered to Kojaian Ventures,
L.L.C. are not purchased by Kojaian Ventures, L.L.C. the net proceeds from this
offering will be reduced by $10,000,002. Additionally, $2,300,000 or $2,675,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount will be deposited into such trustee
account. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target acquisition with which we complete
a business combination (excluding the amount held in the trust account
representing a portion of the underwriters’ discount). Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to finance our
operations, which may include the target business(es) we acquired on the
consummation of the business combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for
working capital, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    We have agreed to pay our corporate stockholder a monthly fee of $7,500 for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Grubb & Ellis
Company for our benefit and is not intended to provide our directors
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the Chicago metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
Grubb & Ellis Company is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
stockholders.

    Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be $1,562,500. We intend to use the excess working
capital (approximately $802,500) for director and officer liability insurance
premiums (approximately $150,000), with the balance of $652,500 being held in
reserve for tax payments and in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as a possible down payment, lock-up or “no-shop” provision, if
necessary, to bear the costs of liquidation and dissolution if in the event we
are unable to effect a business combination within 18 months after the
consummation of this offering (or within 24 months from the consummation of this
offering if a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement
has been executed within 18 months after the consummation of this offering and
the business combination has not yet been consummated within such 18 month
period), as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
our existing stockholder in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants (other than
Grubb & Ellis Company and its affiliates) to assist us with our search for a
target acquisition. We could also use a portion of the funds not being placed in
trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters
of intent designed to keep target acquisitions from “shopping” around for
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
acquisitions) with respect to a particular proposed business combination,
although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into such
a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a 
target acquisition, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund 
a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific 
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our 
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) 
could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or 
conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target acquisitions.

    To the extent that our capital stock or debt securities are used in whole or
in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in
the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination will
be disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance our operations.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock, our proposed credit facility or
debt securities. In such event, the proceeds held in the trust account as well
as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance our operations,
which may include the target business(es) that we acquire on the business
combination, to effect other acquisitions, or for working capital, as determined
by our board of directors at that time. Our corporate stockholder, Grubb & Ellis
Company, has advanced to us a total of $506,950 which was used to pay a portion
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee, AMEX application and listing fees, blue
sky filing fees and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable
without interest on the earlier of October 21, 2006, or the consummation of this
offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in trust.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
“government securities” or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we
are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period that is
not otherwise returned to public stockholders who vote against a business
combination will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Other than the restricted stock to be issued to Mark W. Chrisman, a member
of our Investment Committee and Executive Vice President of Capital Transactions
of Grubb & Ellis Company, in the event of and upon the consummation of a
business combination and the fees payable to Grubb & Ellis Company pursuant to a
long term brokerage services agreement, a long term facilities management
agreement, a long term project management agreement and an agreement to provide
general and administrative services, no compensation of any kind (including
finders, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors or stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or
for any services that they render in order to effectuate, or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. However, such individuals will
receive reimbursement, subject to board approval, for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target acquisitions, performing business due diligence on
suitable target acquisitions and business combinations, as well as traveling to
and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target
acquisitions to examine their operations. Reimbursement
for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and
currently allocated in the above table to “Legal, accounting and other
expenses,” “Due diligence of prospective target acquisitions” and “Working
capital.” Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

    A public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders with respect to any
shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before this offering) will
be entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned
on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of our
liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our existing stockholders
with respect to any shares of our common stock owned by them immediately before
this offering) converts such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount held in trust. In the event that we are unable to
consummate a business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the
trust account, the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit any
rights or claims to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ discount will be distributed on a
pro-rata basis among the public shareholders along with any accrued interest
thereon."

offering will be approximately $44.4 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, payable by us. We
will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by selling stockholders.
We intend to use approximately $2.4 million and $2.0 million of the net proceeds
from this offering to repay amounts outstanding under our senior credit facility
and our subordinated note, respectively.

        º The senior credit facility bears an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus
          2.25% and terminates in July 2007. In June 2005, we borrowed
          approximately $2.0 million under the credit facility. We used this
          amount, together with available cash, to acquire a wholesale industry
          portal, Wholesale411.com, and to fund the costs incurred by us in
          procuring our DoD scrap contract.

        º In May 2003, we issued our subordinated note in exchange for
          $2.0 million in cash. The subordinated note is due in May 2008 and
          bears an annual interest rate of 12%.

    We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for working
capital, general corporate purposes and possible future acquisitions.

    The amounts that we actually expend for working capital and other general
corporate purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors,
including future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash that we generate
from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. We also may use a portion of
the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, products or technologies
that we could utilize in expanding our online auction business or our wholesale
industry portal. We periodically review acquisitions and strategic investment
opportunities that are related to our business, and we believe that it is
desirable to have funds on hand so that we have the ability to make acquisitions
and strategic investments promptly. As of the date of this prospectus, we have
no arrangements, agreements or commitments for acquisitions of any businesses,
products or technologies, and we can give no assurance that we will be able to
consummate any acquisitions or strategic investments or that if consummated such
acquisitions or investments would be on terms that are favorable to us.

    Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term interest bearing investment grade securities."

(1)  Approximately $215,000 of the offering expenses, including SEC, NASD and    
     American Stock Exchange listing and filing fees, approximately $125,000 of  
     legal and accounting expenses, approximately $25,000 for Blue Sky filing    
     fees and related legal fees and expenses, and approximately $22,500 for     
     other miscellaneous fees and expenses, have been paid out of the $300,000 in
     funds loaned to us by Blue Line Advisors, Inc., a private company           
     wholly-owned and controlled by our chief executive officer and president,   
     Gregory Burns, as described below. Since December 31, 2005, we estimate we  
     have also incurred approximately $30,000 in offering expenses, which we     
     expect to pay out of the funds loaned to us by Blue Line Advisors, Inc. In  
     addition, Blue Line Advisors, Inc. has paid an additional $50,000 of legal  
     and accounting expenses on our behalf, and we anticipate that Blue Line     
     Advisors, Inc. will pay an additional $80,000 towards our American Stock    
     Exchange listing and filing fees. These funds will be repaid out of the 
     proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation 
     of this offering.      
    
(2)  Miscellaneous expenses includes reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses     
     incurred on our behalf by the initial stockholders in connection with this  
     offering.                                                                   
    
(3)  These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
     of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
     we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
     estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
     combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination.
     We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
     fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
     fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
     category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.    

    We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses in the transportation and logistics sector and related
industries.

    Of the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private placement of
initial stockholder warrants, $76,800,000, or $88,320,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at
The Bank of New York. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. In connection with the consummation of an initial business
combination, the net proceeds held in the trust account, excluding $2,400,000 in
deferred underwriting discounts and commissions (or $2,760,000 if the
over-allotment option is exercised in full) and any amounts paid to public
stockholders electing to exercise their conversion rights, may be used as
follows: (i) as consideration to the sellers of the target business, including
offering-related expenses, (ii) in deferred underwriting discounts and
commissions to the underwriters, or (iii) to public stockholders electing to
convert their shares pursuant to their conversion rights. Any amounts not so
allocated may be used to finance operations of the target businesses or for
general working capital.

    In contrast to many other companies with business plans similar to ours that
must combine with one or more target businesses that have a fair market value
equal to 80% or more of the acquiror’s net assets, we will not combine with a
target business or businesses unless the fair market value of such entity or
entities meets a minimum valuation threshold of 80% of the balance in the trust
account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of
$2,400,000, or $2,760,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full). We
have used this criterion to provide investors and our management team with
greater certainty as to the fair market value that a target business or
businesses must have in order to qualify for a business combination with us. The
determination of net assets would require us to have deducted all liabilities
from total assets to arrive at the balance of net assets. Given the on-going
nature of legal, accounting, stockholder meeting and other expenses that will be
incurred immediately before and at the time of a business combination, the
amount of our total liabilities may be difficult to ascertain at a particular
point in time with a high degree of certainty. Accordingly, we have determined
to use the valuation threshold of 80% of the balance in the trust account
(excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of $2,400,000, or
$2,760,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for the fair
market value of the target business or businesses with which we combine so that
our management team will have greater certainty when selecting, and our
investors will have greater certainty when voting to approve or disapprove a
proposed combination with, a target business or businesses that will meet the
minimum valuation criterion for our initial business combination.

    We have agreed to pay Blue Line Advisors, Inc., a private company
wholly-owned and controlled by our chief executive officer and president,
Gregory Burns, approximately $7,500 per month for office space and
administrative support services. This arrangement is being agreed to for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Gregory Burns compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe that such fees are at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon the earlier of our completion of a
business combination and our liquidation we will not be required to pay these
monthly fees.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $989,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $125,000), with
the balance of $864,000 being held in reserve for
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as
for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. In
the event we use a portion of our excess working capital to make a down payment,
fund a “no-shop” provision or to pay an exclusivity or similar fee or expense,
and are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of an
agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have sufficient
amount of working capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due
diligence and pay other expenses related to finding another suitable business
combination without securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to
secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging
market research and valuation firms, as well as other third party consultants.
None of our officers or directors will receive any compensation for their due
diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they
may incur on our behalf while performing due diligence of prospective target
businesses. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the net proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions, or for general working capital.
    Blue Line Advisors, Inc., a private company wholly-owned and controlled by
our chief executive officer and president, Gregory Burns, has advanced to us
through a loan a total of approximately $300,000, which was used to pay
approximately $215,000 of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee, American Stock
Exchange listing fee, legal and accounting expenses, Blue Sky filing fees and
related legal fees and expenses, and other miscellaneous fees and expenses.
Since December 31, 2005, we estimate we have also incurred approximately $30,000
in offering expenses, which we expect to pay out of the funds loaned to us by
Blue Line Advisors, Inc. In addition, to date Blue Line Advisors, Inc. has
incurred approximately $50,000 of out-of-pocket expenses on our behalf in
connection with this offering, and has committed to incur an additional $80,000
on our behalf, which will be subject to such reimbursement as discussed below.
The loan from Blue Line Advisors, Inc. will be payable without interest on the
earlier of March 31, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be
repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust. In
connection with this offering, James Martell, our chairman, Gregory Burns, our
chief executive officer and president, Mitchel Friedman, our chief financial
officer, treasurer and corporate secretary, and Charles Royce, one of our
initial stockholders, have advanced to Blue Line Advisors, Inc. through loans,
collectively, a total of approximately $430,000, which Blue Line Advisors, Inc.
has used to make its loan to us, and to pay a portion of the fees and expenses
of this offering incurred on our behalf by Blue Line Advisors, Inc. In addition,
we have agreed to reimburse Blue Line Advisors, Inc. and our initial
stockholders for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them on our behalf in
connection with this offering. Each of Messrs. Martell, Burns, Friedman and
Royce’s loans to Blue Line Advisors, Inc. will be repaid at the time its loan to
us is repaid, and any expenses incurred on our behalf in connection with this
offering are reimbursed.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested in one or more money market funds,
selected by us, which invest principally in either short-term securities issued
or guaranteed by the United States having a rating in the highest investment
category granted thereby by a recognized credit rating agency at the time of
acquisition or tax exempt municipal bonds issued by governmental entities
located within the United States, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income derived
from investment of the net proceeds not held in trust during this period will be
used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including 
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. Any 
interest income derived from the net proceeds held in trust, after deducting 
and paying any applicable federal, state or local taxes incurred as a result 
of such interest income, will be retained by the trust account. Any federal, 
state or local taxes incurred as a result of interest income earned by the 
net proceeds held in trust will be paid out of the funds held in the trust account.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the report of
Eisner LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, includes an
explanatory paragraph stating that our ability to continue as a going concern is
dependent upon consummation of this offering.

    Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative services fees as
described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) will be paid to any of our initial stockholders, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our initial stockholders will
receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, less any amounts owed to third party creditors, if any, and any
applicable federal, state or local taxes incurred as a result of such interest)
only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares
into cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

          NorthStar Hospitality LLC (see ""Certain Relationships and Related
          Party Transactions—NorthStar Hospitality LLC Preferred Equity Interest
          in Clift"");

        º approximately $42.8 million to initially finance a portion of the
          purchase price of James Hotel Scottsdale, which may be later replaced
          with permanent mortgage financing (see ""Prospectus Summary—Recent
          Developments—Purchase of James Hotel Scottsdale""); and

        º approximately $8.7 million for general corporate purposes, including
          hotel renovations.

    In connection with our mezzanine loan and mortgage debt repayments, we
expect to pay accrued interest on the amounts being repaid out of working
capital. We expect that this amount will be approximately $2.5 million. The
mezzanine loans and mortgage debt referred to in the first bullet point above
were incurred in June 2005. The proceeds of this debt were used for the
following two purposes: (i) to repay $471.0 million of previously existing
mortgage debt and mezzanine loans on the same properties, bearing interest at a
weighted average rate of LIBOR (3.3% at June 30, 2005) plus a spread of 450
basis points and (ii) to make a distribution of $83.2 million to Morgans Hotel
Group LLC, the majority of which was used by Morgans Hotel Group LLC for the
repayment of indebtedness. See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operation—Liquidity and Capital
Resources—Financing Activities"" below for a description of this refinancing. In
connection with the transfer of a controlling interest in our company, we expect
to pay any transfer tax to New York City and New York State related to our three
New York City hotels out of working capital.

    In addition, if the option to purchase additional shares is exercised, we
will contribute the net proceeds from that exercise to Morgans Group LLC in
exchange for a number of membership units in Morgans Group LLC equal to the
number of shares issued and Morgans Group LLC will use the additional net
proceeds for general corporate purposes.

    Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in
interest-bearing, short-term investment grade securities or money-market
accounts. Such investments may include, for example, government and government
agency certificates, certificates of deposit, interest-bearing bank deposits and
mortgage loan participations."

$33.2 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
based on the initial public offering price of $6.00 per share, after deducting
the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

    We intend to use the proceeds of this offering as follows:

        º approximately $7.0 to $10.0 million for sales and marketing activities
          and market development for Zanaflex Capsules and Fampridine-SR, if
          approved by the FDA;

        º approximately $20.0 to $25.0 million principally to complete our
          current Fampridine-SR clinical trial and to conduct other activities
          related to the filing of an NDA for Fampridine-SR, as well as for
          research and development, including for Zanaflex and our preclinical
          studies related to our Chondroitinase, Neuregulin and Remyelinating
          Antibodies programs; and

        º the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include the
          payment of one or more sales-based milestones to Elan for Zanaflex
          Capsules, the funding of working capital, capital expenditures and the
          potential acquisition or licensing of pharmaceutical products or
          product candidates that are complementary to our own.

    We recently entered into our revenue interest assignment arrangement with
PRF in order to provide additional immediate funding to support the
commercialization of Zanaflex Capsules. All funds from the PRF transaction must
be used for the commercialization and other activities and obligations related
specifically to our Zanaflex operations. We currently intend to use $3 million
of the PRF proceeds to pay a Zanaflex Capsules sales-based milestone due to Elan
on March 31, 2006 and may use additional PRF proceeds to fund a portion of the
sales and marketing activities and market development for Zanaflex Capsules
described above, which will free up proceeds from this offering for other
purposes.

    We expect that the proceeds of this offering will allow us to complete our
current Fampridine-SR Phase 3 clinical trial. The amount and timing of our
actual expenditures on sales and marketing and our research and development
programs will depend on numerous factors, including the progress of our research
and development activities, the progress of our clinical trials and regulatory
approval process, the number and breadth of our product development programs,
our success in marketing Zanaflex Capsules, and any in-licensing and acquisition
activities. Our research programs are in an early stage of development and it is
difficult to predict what advances, if any, we will make in our research
activities using the proceeds of this offering. Accordingly, we will retain
broad discretion in the allocation and use of the proceeds of this offering.
Currently we have no specific plans or commitments related to any acquisitions
or licenses.

    Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest them in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.

    Under our revenue interest assignment arrangement with PRF, if this offering
results in our having a total market capitalization in excess of $150.0 million,
we will have the option, for 180 days, to repurchase PRF's rights at the
""put/call price"" in effect on the date such right is exercised. The put/call
price on a given date is the greater of (i) 150% of the payments made by PRF to
us as of such date, less all payments received by PRF from us as of such date,
and (ii) an amount that would generate an internal rate of return to PRF of 25%
of all payments made by PRF to us as of such date, taking into account the
amount and timing of all payments received by PRF from us as of such date. We do
not currently intend to exercise this option if it becomes exercisable, but we
may reevaluate whether we would exercise the option during the 180-day period.
If we do exercise any such option, we would use a portion of the proceeds from
this offering to make the repayment. Unless earlier terminated, the revenue
interest assignment arrangement will expire on December 31, 2015."

approximately $114.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their
over-allotment option to purchase up to 1,419,750 additional shares of our
common stock), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

In connection with this offering, we intend to enter into a new $115.0 million
senior revolving credit facility. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering, together with approximately $63.0 million (or approximately $40.6
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) of
borrowings under this new senior revolving credit facility and approximately
$18.9 million of available cash, as follows:

     (1)  approximately $106.3 million to repay all of our currently outstanding  
          7.5% senior secured notes, including a prepayment premium of            
          approximately $11.5 million;                                            

     (2)  approximately $57.1 million to repay all of MHCI’s currently outstanding
          14.0% senior secured notes, including a prepayment premium of           
          approximately $9.4 million;                                             

     (3)  approximately $8.4 million to pay the termination fee in connection with
          the termination of MHLLC’s management agreement with Castle Harlan,     
          Inc.;                                                                   

     (4)  approximately $0.7 million to pay the financing fees related to our     
          proposed new $115.0 million senior revolving credit facility;           

     (5)  approximately $1.0 million to pay the investment banking and legal fees 
          in connection with the tender offer for our 7.5% senior secured notes   
          and the repurchase of MHCI’s 14.0% senior secured notes; and            

     (6)  approximately $0.3 million to collateralize outstanding letters of      
          credit issued under our current working capital facility.               

As described below, the foregoing amounts that we expect to expend to repay our
7.5% senior secured notes and MHCI’s 14.0% senior secured notes are estimates.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we will apply the net
proceeds we receive from the issuance of shares upon exercise of that option for
the foregoing purposes, which will reduce the amount of borrowings under our
proposed new senior revolving credit facility that are required for those
purposes by a like amount.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the selling stockholders’ sale of
shares of common stock in this offering.

Pending use for the purposes set forth above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.

As of October 2, 2005 and as of the date hereof, $105.0 million aggregate
principal amount at maturity of our 7.5% senior secured notes were outstanding.
The aggregate principal amount at maturity represents the face amount of the
notes. On January 3, 2006, we launched a tender offer to repurchase up to $68.25
million aggregate principal amount at maturity of those notes (which constitutes
65% of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the outstanding notes) for
a total offer price of approximately $69.6 million, including accrued interest
and a premium. In addition to the 7.5% senior secured notes that we intend to
repurchase pursuant to the tender offer, we intend to redeem $36.75 million
aggregate principal amount at maturity of those notes (which constitutes 35% of
the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the outstanding notes). We
estimate the cost to redeem those notes will be approximately $36.7 million,
including accrued interest and a premium. As of January 18, 2006, at least 65%
of the aggregate principal amount at maturity of the
outstanding 7.5% senior secured notes had been tendered in the tender offer.
Accordingly, after consummation of this offering, we intend to repurchase
pursuant to the tender offer or redeem all of the outstanding 7.5% senior
secured notes. However, we do not intend to redeem or arrange to redeem any
notes until after the expiration of the tender offer.

As a result of the expected merger of MHCI into us prior to the consummation of
this offering, we will become liable for MHCI’s existing 14.0% senior secured
notes. As of October 2, 2005, approximately $44.3 million of aggregate principal
amount of 14.0% senior secured notes remained outstanding, including interest
paid in the form of additional notes, which we refer to as PIK notes. We expect
to pay approximately $57.1 million to repurchase those outstanding notes,
including accrued interest and a premium, concurrently with the closing of this
offering.

The amounts that we expect to expend to repay all of the outstanding 7.5% senior
secured notes and 14.0% senior secured notes appearing in this preliminary
prospectus are estimates. The actual amounts we expend to repay those notes are
subject to uncertainties, including the prevailing interest rates at the time we
repay the notes, and therefore may differ from these estimated amounts. To the
extent that the amounts we pay to retire the 7.5% senior secured notes and the
14.0% senior secured notes exceed the estimated amounts, we intend to pay the
excess through borrowings under our proposed new senior revolving credit
facility.

The interest rate and maturity of the indebtedness that we intend to repay using
the net proceeds from this offering are described below:

7.5% Senior Secured Notes. Our 7.5% senior secured notes were issued at a
discount of 15.0% and a yield to maturity of 12.005% including the accretion of
the discount and the amortization of the related deferred financing costs. The
notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a senior secured basis by all
of our present and future domestic restricted subsidiaries and are secured by
substantially all of the tangible and intangible assets of us and of our
domestic restricted subsidiaries, as well as by a pledge of a portion of the
stock of the subsidiaries owned by us and by our domestic restricted
subsidiaries, in each case subject to the prior ranking claims on such assets by
the lender under our current working capital facility and certain other secured
indebtedness. Our domestic restricted subsidiaries presently consist of all of
our domestic subsidiaries that either own restaurants or own subsidiaries that
own restaurants. The 7.5% senior secured notes mature on July 1, 2010.

14.0% Senior Secured Notes. Interest on MHCI’s 14.0% senior secured notes is
payable in cash or by the issuance of PIK notes in lieu of cash interest
payments. Pursuant to the notes, if at the end of a fiscal quarter we meet
certain financial tests, MHCI is required to repay, to the extent permitted,
outstanding PIK notes. The 14.0% senior secured notes are secured by a pledge of
all of MHCI’s assets, which include the stock of Morton’s Restaurant Group, Inc.
The 14.0% senior secured notes mature on December 30, 2010. The proceeds from
the original issuance of the 14.0% senior secured notes were used to pay a
dividend distribution of $36.9 million to the equity holders of MHLLC and to pay
fees and expenses related to the issuance of those notes."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds of the sale of shares of our
common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $31.4 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay in full the principal and accrued interest that will be
outstanding on our loan and security agreement with Comerica Bank at the
completion of this offering. The loan and security agreement is subject to a
variable interest rate equal to either the prime rate announced by Comerica Bank
or the LIBOR rate per annum plus up to 3.25% per annum, and has a final maturity
date of August 2009. We used the proceeds of the loan for repayment of a $3
million credit facility with Silicon Valley Bank, repayment of approximately $9
million in subordinated promissory notes held by entities affiliated with Summit
Partners and payment of special distributions to the holders of our common stock
and redeemable preferred stock totaling $20 million.

Additional purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets and
to obtain additional capital. Except as set forth above, we currently have no
specific plans for the use of the net proceeds of this offering. We anticipate
that we will use the net proceeds received by us from this offering after
repayment of indebtedness for general corporate purposes, including further
development and expansion of our service offerings as well as possible
acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets. We have
no current agreements or commitments with respect to any material future
acquisitions. Pending such uses, we plan to invest the remaining portion of the
net proceeds in highly liquid, investment grade securities."

        be issued to the former holders of our Class L and Class A common stock and
        who are entitled to payment of a $30 million liquidation preference.       

In addition, in the event the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option,
we could use the proceeds therefrom to pay a portion of the $30 million dividend
we expect to pay during the first six months of fiscal 2006 to the holders of
our Class B common stock. We may also use other funds to pay the dividend which
are currently available to us or that become available to us in the future, such
as cash on hand, cash received in connection with future equity issuances and
cash received in connection with future financings or refinancings. If such
funds are not available to pay a dividend during the first six months of fiscal
2006, holders of our Class B common stock will remain entitled to a $30 million
liquidation preference prior to the payment of any dividends on our common
stock.

The CVC Entities, the Quadrangle Entities and certain members of management are
the former holders of our Class L common stock and will be issued our Class B
common stock. Approximately $140.5 million, or 88.2% (or 76.6% if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full), of
the net proceeds of this offering will be used to terminate the advisory
agreements as well as to repay the portion of our Floating Rate Notes the
proceeds of which were used to pay a dividend to the former holders of our Class
L common stock and could be used to pay a dividend on the Class B common stock.
Accordingly, these amounts will not be used to further invest in our business or
reduce our debt, other than the repayment of these Floating Rate Notes.

The Floating Rate Notes were originally issued on October 17, 2005, bear
interest at a floating rate currently based on the three-month LIBOR plus 8.75%
and mature October 15, 2013. We used approximately $125.0 million of the net
proceeds from the Floating Rate Notes to pay a dividend to the holders of our
Class L common stock, and the remaining net proceeds of approximately $2.5
million will be used for general corporate purposes.

Pending the uses described herein, we will invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade securities."

approximately $706.4 million.

We intend to use these proceeds, together with cash and additional borrowings
under our credit agreement, as follows:

        º $359.8 million to repay $350.0 million in principal plus accrued and
          unpaid interest under the interim bank loan incurred in connection

          acquisition;

          unpaid interest of $0.9 million under the TXOK credit facility

          $200.0 million in principal plus accrued and unpaid interest of
          $2.8 million under the TXOK term loan, both loans having been incurred

Since all of the net proceeds of this offering will be used to repay
indebtedness and redeem the TXOK preferred stock, we will not have any net
proceeds remaining to further expand or invest in our business or for other
general corporate purposes.

If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised, we intend to use the
proceeds to repay borrowings under our credit agreement or the TXOK credit
facility.

Borrowings under the interim bank loan bear interest at a rate of 10% and mature
on July 3, 2006. Borrowings under the interim bank loan were incurred by
Holdings II to finance a portion of the purchase price for all the outstanding
stock of EXCO Holdings in the Equity Buyout. 

Borrowings under the TXOK credit facility bear interest at a fluctuating rate of
interest (the applicable interest rate was 7.125% as of December 31, 2005) and
mature on September 27, 2009. Borrowings under the TXOK credit facility were
incurred by TXOK to finance a portion of the purchase price for the ONEOK Energy
acquisition and to provide working capital to TXOK. The TXOK credit facility is 
secured by a first priority lien and security interest in TXOK's oil and natural gas
properties as well as the capital stock of its subsidiaries.

Borrowings under the TXOK term loan bear interest at a rate of interest which is
either the prime rate plus 3.5% or the London InterBank Offered Rate, or LIBOR,
plus 4.5% (the applicable interest rate was 8.875% as of December 31, 2005) and
mature on September 27, 2010. Borrowings under the TXOK term loan were incurred
by TXOK to finance a portion of the purchase price for the ONEOK Energy
acquisition. The TXOK term loan is secured by a perfected second lien on all 
assets securing the TXOK credit facility.  

The redemption price for the TXOK preferred stock will be (i) cash in the amount
of $150.0 million plus accrued and unpaid dividends at an annualized rate of 15%
and (ii) that number of shares of common stock of EXCO Resources, cash, or any
combination thereof, at the election of the holder of the TXOK preferred stock,
necessary to produce an overall 23% annualized rate of return on the stated
value of the TXOK preferred stock as of the date of redemption. For purposes of
calculating the rate of return, the common stock of EXCO Resources will be
valued at the lesser of $12.00 or the per share offering price to the public in
this offering. For purposes of this discussion of the use of proceeds we have
assumed that the redemption price is paid entirely in cash. We have reserved up
to 383,562 shares of common stock issuable upon redemption of the TXOK preferred
stock if the holder of the TXOK preferred stock elects to take shares of our
common stock in lieu of cash. The issuance of this common stock would reduce the
cash redemption price by up to $4.6 million. The holder of the TXOK preferred
stock is BP EXCO Holdings LP, an entity controlled by Mr. Boone Pickens, one of
our directors."

stock offered by us will be approximately $94.9 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us in connection with this offering. All shares of our common stock that are
subject to the underwriters' over-allotment option will be sold to the
underwriters by the selling stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of shares to be sold by the selling stockholders.

We will use approximately $5.9 million of the net proceeds we receive from the
sale of our common stock in this offering to repay all amounts outstanding under
our amended and restated credit facility. The amount outstanding under the
credit facility at September 30, 2005 was $5.0 million, and the amount
outstanding as of December 31, 2005 was $5.9 million. Interest on this credit
facility accrues at floating rates we select on each borrowing, equal to either
the Bank of America prime rate, or a calculated Eurodollar rate equal to an
adjusted LIBOR rate plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.50% depending on our
EBITDA for the most recently completed four fiscal quarters. The effective
interest rate as of December 31, 2005 was 7.25% per annum. Interest accrues on
the credit facility monthly and is paid at the end of each month. The credit
facility matures on October 26, 2008. We used a portion of the proceeds of
borrowings under the credit facility to fund a cash distribution of $3.0 million
which was declared to members as of December 31, 2004 of our predecessor limited
liability company pursuant to the operating agreement for that entity. In
addition, we used $1.3 million for the purchase of our manufacturing operation
in Mexico and associated operating assets in April 2005 and $1.6 million to
purchase inventory and for working capital purposes.

We will use an additional $2.0 million of the net proceeds to repay all amounts
outstanding under Foam Creations's credit facility. Interest on this facility
accrues at the current Canadian prime rate plus 0.50% and matures in 2006. We
will also use $532,000 of the proceeds to repay a loan made to Foam Creations by
National Bank of Canada, which accrues interest at the current Canadian prime
rate plus 0.75% and matures on March 1, 2006, $797,000 to repay a loan made to
Foam Creations by National Bank of Canada, which accrues interest at the current
Canadian prime rate plus 0.75% and matures in October 2012, and $2.4 million of
the proceeds to repay a loan made to Foam Creations by Development Bank of
Canada, which includes interest at a rate LIBOR plus 3.3% and matures in
August 2011.

All of our outstanding Series A preferred stock will automatically convert into
shares of our common stock in connection with the closing of this offering, and
we will pay all accrued and unpaid dividends on the preferred stock in
connection with the conversion. As of December 31, 2005, there was $161,000 in
unpaid dividends accrued on the Series A preferred stock.

We expect to use approximately $11.2 million of the net proceeds we receive from
this offering for capital expenditures related to increasing our manufacturing
capacity and improving our infrastructure, including approximately $3.5 million
to expand and upgrade our existing information technology systems. We also
intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to further develop our international
operations and to increase our marketing activities, although we have not yet
allocated specific amounts for these purposes. In addition, we may use a portion
of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses or products
or to obtain additional manufacturing facilities. We have no commitments with
respect to any acquisition or investment, and we are not involved in
negotiations with respect to any similar material transaction. We intend to use
the remainder of the net proceeds we receive from this offering for working
capital and general corporate purposes.

The principal purposes of this offering are as follows:

        º to obtain additional capital;

        º to reduce outstanding debt;

        º to create a public market for our common stock;

        º to provide liquidity for our existing stockholders;

        º to improve the effectiveness of our equity compensation plans in
          attracting and retaining key employees; and

        º to enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, products or
          technologies.

We will have broad discretion in the application of the balance of the net
proceeds. You will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial
or other information on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds.
Pending application of the net proceeds we receive from this offering, we will
invest the proceeds in government securities and other short-term,
investment-grade interest bearing securities."

their overallotment option. Actual amounts may vary from the estimates shown
below. The table also assumes that approximately $50.0 million aggregate
principal amount of 11% notes are tendered in the Tender Offer and that an Early
Tender Payment is paid with respect to all such 11% notes (approximately
$47.7 million aggregate principal amount of 11% notes had been tendered as of
the Early Tender Payment Deadline). Any increase in the principal amount of
11% notes actually tendered would result in a corresponding reduction in the
amount of proceeds from this offering that would be available for general
corporate purposes, including repurchasing shares of Class A common stock and/
or funding any potential acquisitions.

      Pursuant to the indenture governing the 11% notes, CSC will loan all of
the net proceeds from this offering to Coinmach Corp., which will then
distribute such proceeds to CSC in accordance with the terms of its
indebtedness. CSC will use such proceeds to fund the Total Tender Offer
Consideration and pay related fees and expenses. The 11% notes subject to the
Tender Offer are scheduled to mature on December 1, 2024.

      To the extent proceeds from this offering remain after consummation of the
Tender Offer and payment of related fees and expenses, such proceeds will be
used for general corporate purposes, including (i) to repurchase all or any
portion of the 2,199,413 shares of Class A common stock underlying IDSs that are
currently owned by an affiliate of GTCR, at a repurchase price of $8.505 per
share (equal to the public offering price of the Class A common stock offered
hereby, net of any underwriting discounts and commissions), and/or (ii) to fund
all or a portion of any potential acquisitions.

      To the extent proceeds from this offering are insufficient to fund the
Total Tender Offer Consideration, we will obtain additional funds from available
borrowings under the revolver portion of the amended and restated credit
facility (under which borrowings of $68.6 million are currently available)
and/or under other financing arrangements, including but not limited to an
amendment to the amended and restated credit facility.

      The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment
option will be used to repurchase shares of Class B common stock to the extent
permitted under the indenture governing the 11% notes. Provided such repurchase
is permitted under such indenture, if the overallotment option is exercised in
full generating anticipated net proceeds of approximately $13.659 million, we
would repurchase approximately 1,605,995 shares of Class B common stock at a
repurchase price of $8.505 per share (equal to the public offering price of the
Class A common stock offered hereby, net of any underwriting discounts and
commissions). If such repurchase is not permitted under the indenture, such
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes consistent with the terms
of the indenture.

of the 21,000,000 common units we are offering, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we expect to receive
additional net proceeds of approximately $62.3 million, all of which we would
use to fund the redemption of 3,150,000 common units from our current equity
owners.

We will use approximately $175.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering
to repay a portion of the indebtedness outstanding under our existing $600
million term loan agreement. We expect to repay the remaining outstanding
indebtedness under our existing $600 million term loan agreement using
approximately $4.5 million of cash on hand and approximately $420 million of
borrowings under our proposed new $500 million credit facility, which is
expected to have a five-year term. Wachovia Bank, National Association, one of
the lenders under our existing term loan facility, is an affiliate of Wachovia
Capital Markets, LLC, an underwriter of this offering. Please read
“Underwriting.” The borrowings under our existing $600 million term loan
agreement were used to fund a distribution to our existing equity owners in June
2005. Our $600 million term loan agreement bears interest at an initial rate of
LIBOR plus 3%. We expect to enter into our proposed new credit facility
concurrently with the closing of this offering.

We will use a portion of the remaining net proceeds to fund our acquisition from
ETP of an additional 3.64 million ETP units (including Class F units). This
total is comprised of approximately 1.07 million ETP common units and
approximately 2.57 million Class F units. The Class F units will be issued, in
lieu of additional ETP common units, to comply with the rules of the New York
Stock Exchange as they relate to ETP. Class F units will generally be entitled
to receive the same cash distributions per unit as the common units of ETP and
will be convertible into an equivalent number of common units of ETP upon
receipt of ETP unitholder approval. For a description of the terms of the Class
F units, please read “Material Provisions of Energy Transfer Partners’
Partnership Agreement —ETP Units—Class F Units.” We will also use a portion of
the net proceeds to redeem 3.5 million common units from our current equity
owners. Finally, we will use any net proceeds remaining after the uses described
above for other partnership purposes. For purposes of our pro forma financial
statements included in this prospectus, we have assumed that we will purchase
these additional ETP units at a price of $36.00 per unit; however, the actual
purchase price will be determined by negotiation between us and the conflicts
committee of the board of directors of ETP’s general partner, subject to a
requirement of the New York Stock Exchange that the purchase price per ETP unit
be the fair market value of these units.

If the underwriters exercise all or any portion of their over-allotment option,
we will use all of the net proceeds from the sale of our common units sold
pursuant to the exercise of that option to fund the redemption of an equal
number of common units from our current equity owners."

an initial public offering price of $9.75 per share, after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, are
estimated to be approximately $33.4 million, or approximately $38.7 million if
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

      •    $1.2 million for contractual commitments currently in place and payable 
           through September 30, 2006 in connection with acquisitions of digital   
           rights to music recordings;                                             

      •    an estimated $0.8 million for acquisition of property and equipment,    
           including processing and encoding equipment and upgrades to our royalty 
           payment system; and                                                     

      •    an estimated $31.4 million will be used for general corporate purposes, 
           including working capital, future acquisitions of digital rights to     
           music recordings and funding operating expenses.                        

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire companies that
own digital rights to music recordings or companies with complementary
technologies or businesses. However, we currently have no commitments or
agreements and are not involved in any negotiations with respect to any such
transactions.

Other than the contractual commitments, the amounts set forth above are
estimates, and the amounts that we will spend for these uses cannot be exactly
determined. For example, the net proceeds we actually expend for fixed assets
may be greater or less than the amount shown above depending on our rate of
growth. The amount actually expended for general corporate purposes, including
working capital, could vary significantly depending on a number of factors,
including future revenue growth, profitability and cash flows. The actual amount
expended for future content acquisition is even more difficult to predict as we
have no commitments or agreements in place, other than those disclosed herein.
As these negotiations will take place subsequent to this offering, the amount of
the net proceeds to be used to acquire additional digital rights could vary
significantly depending on a number of factors, including our ability to locate
content, enter into binding acquisition agreements on favorable terms, the
structure of future transactions as perpetual or long-term license agreements,
and the negotiated purchase price and payment terms. As a result, we will retain
broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.
Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
excess funds in short-term, investment-grade securities. We cannot predict
whether the proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

$74.3 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of
the shares by the selling shareholders.

    We intend to use (1) approximately $48.9 million of the net proceeds to
redeem $43.75 million principal amount of our senior secured floating rate
notes, due April 1, 2012 and pay a prepayment premium and accrued and unpaid
interest thereon, (2) an aggregate of $9.0 million to make a one-time payment of
$3.0 million to affiliates of each of Texas Pacific Group, Francisco Partners
and Shah Capital Partners, in consideration for the termination of our
obligations to pay annual fees under advisory agreements with each of them, and
(3) the remainder for general corporate purposes, which may include expansion of
our sales and marketing and research and development efforts, working capital,
capital expenditures and potential acquisitions of complementary businesses,
products and technologies (although as of the date of this prospectus, we have
no commitment or agreement relating to any such acquisition). Other than as
described above, we have not determined how the net proceeds will be used.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the
remaining net proceeds of this offering. Pending their use, we intend to invest
the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment grade instruments.

    As of January 1, 2006, the interest rate on our senior secured floating rate
notes was approximately 10.03%. The net proceeds from the offering of our senior
secured floating rate notes were used (1) to repay $42.3 million of outstanding
indebtedness under our old credit facility, (2) to redeem all of the outstanding
shares of our Series A redeemable preferred shares from Modular, L.L.C. (which
was principally owned by Texas Pacific Group, Francisco Partners and Shah
Capital Partners) for an aggregate of $65.1 million and (3) for general
corporate purposes (approximately $12.7 million)."

will be approximately $34.0 million.

    We currently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:
   •  approximately $3.0 million to expand our sales and marketing capabilities;  
  
   •  approximately $5.0 million to fund certain research and development         
      activities, including clinical Phase III trials for VP002, our Histrelin CPP

    As of February 1, 2006, we had approximately $1,560,000 in outstanding
borrowings under our line of credit, which amounts bear interest at 8.1% as of
such date. Borrowings under the line of credit mature on October 20, 2007.

Amounts repaid under the line of credit will be available for future borrowings.
    In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
acquire products or technologies that are complementary to our current or future
business and product lines, but we currently have no commitments, agreements, or
understandings relating to any of these types of transactions.

    We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash, cash generated from future sales of Vantas, and our line of
credit, will be sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements for at
least the next 12 months, including our requirements related to the
commercialization of Vantas and further development of our product candidates.
    The allocation of the net proceeds of this offering described above
represents our best current estimate of our projected operating requirements.
However, the exact amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several
factors, including the success of our commercialization activities and the
progress of our clinical trials and other development efforts as well as the
amount of cash used in our operations. Accordingly, our management will have
broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and investors will be
relying on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the
proceeds of this offering. We reserve the right to change the use of these
proceeds as a result of certain contingencies such as the results of our
commercialization activities, competitive developments, opportunities to acquire
or in-license products, technologies or businesses and other factors.

    Pending the uses described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in short- and medium-term, interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

broadband phones for bundling with VoIP services, as well as for the purchase of
related components and the shipping and warehousing of completed inventory.
Manufacturing of our phones and components will be done to our specifications
based upon our designs and will be provided on a contract basis by overseas
providers. Although we intend to carry inventory, the actual amount of proceeds
expended on our design, engineering and manufacturing efforts and the allocation
of such proceeds between our phone/service bundles will depend on actual demand
for our phones.

We intend to use approximately $965,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to

expenses shall include (i) the payment of fees to Future Marketing, LLC (a
multi-person marketing and sales company under common ownership with The Future,

development and execution of our marketing plans, manages our accounts, assists

China.

The remaining net proceeds of this offering will be allocated to working capital
and general corporate purposes, including payments to our service providers,
office space lease payments, directors and officers insurance premiums, salaries
and benefits for executive and administrative personnel, including travel and
associated expenses, and other general and administrative costs.

The above represents our best estimate of the allocation of net proceeds of this
offering. We may, as our development and marketing efforts progress, find it
necessary to reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above-described
categories or use portions of the proceeds for other purposes, including for
acquisitions of complementary businesses, phones or technologies; however, we
have no current agreements or commitments to make any potential acquisition. In
addition, our estimates may prove to be inaccurate, new phones or product
changes may be undertaken which may require us to modify manufacturing
requirements and/or product delivery schedules, or which may require additional
expenditures and/or unforeseen expenses may occur.

Based on current assumptions relating to our business plan, we anticipate that
the net proceeds of this offering, together with certain baseline levels of
anticipated revenues and accounts receivable financing, will satisfy our capital
requirements for approximately 12 months following the consummation of this
offering. These assumptions include the following:

  •   our initial phones are produced, shipped and delivered on schedule;

  •   expected customer purchase commitments for phones are received;

  •   end users who purchase our bundled services remain active users of such    
      services at anticipated rates;                                             

  •   we are able to secure necessary accounts receivable financing; and

  •   customers pay for our phones in a timely manner.

If we determine to accelerate our business plan or if our plans otherwise change
or our assumptions prove inaccurate, we may need to seek financing sooner than
currently anticipated, incur additional financing or reduce or curtail our
operations. We cannot assure you that financing will become available as and
when needed. We have broad discretion over the ultimate specific allocation of
the proceeds of this offering.

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we will
realize additional net proceeds of approximately $2,357,730, which will be added
to our working capital. All or a portion of these over-allotment proceeds may be
used to acquire complementary businesses or technologies or otherwise obtain the
right to use complementary technologies that could broaden or enhance our
phones. However, we have no current agreements or commitments to make any
potential acquisition. In addition, if the 3,350,000 redeemable warrants offered
pursuant to this prospectus and the 1,475,667 redeemable warrants issued in
exchange for our private warrants are exercised, we will realize proceeds
related to their exercise of approximately $24,369,618 before payment of any
solicitation fees that may be due. If and when we receive these additional
proceeds, they are also expected to be allocated to our working capital.

We will invest proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described
above principally in United States government securities, short-term
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term interest-bearing
investments."

We expect that the net proceeds from this offering will enable us to:

    •   expand manufacturing and commercial distribution of our multi-handset,     
        cordless phones bundled with Pay N’ Talk prepaid long distance provided by 
        IDT and our digital, multi-handset broadband phones bundled with VoIP

        design and develop new phone/service bundles; and                          

    •   expand our sales and marketing capabilities.

We intend to use approximately $11,270,000 of the net proceeds of this offering
for the contract manufacturing of our multi-handset cordless phones for bundling
with Pay N’ Talk prepaid long distance services, and our digital, multi-handset
broadband phones for bundling with VoIP services, as well as for the purchase of
related components and the shipping and warehousing of completed inventory.
Manufacturing of our phones and components will be done to our specifications
based upon our designs and will be provided on a contract basis by overseas
providers. Although we intend to carry inventory, the actual amount of proceeds
expended on our design, engineering and manufacturing efforts and the allocation
of such proceeds between our phone/service bundles will depend on actual demand
for our phones.

We intend to use approximately $965,000 of the net proceeds of this offering to
support and expand our sales and marketing infrastructure and activities. These
expenses shall include (i) the payment of fees to Future Marketing, LLC (a
multi-person marketing and sales company under common ownership with The Future,
LLC, one of our founding shareholders) that, among other things, assists in the
development and execution of our marketing plans, manages our accounts, assists
in our product development and handles our back-office customer functions, (ii)
the payment of salaries and benefits for existing and newly hired marketing,
sales and project management personnel, including certain salaries accrued since
July 1, 2005, (iii) costs associated with the development of packaging,
advertising, retail displays and collateral marketing materials and (iv) costs
related to the establishment of sales channels into targeted retail outlets.

We intend to use approximately $425,000 of the net proceeds of this offering for
product enhancement and development and related activities. This amount includes
approximately $335,000 for sourcing and internal design of product improvements
and new phones, as well as for external engineering and product development
conducted in China through companies we presently utilize for manufacturing
services, and approximately $90,000 for technology and support services in the
United States to coordinate our overseas development efforts.

We intend to use approximately $175,000 of the net proceeds of the offering for
the design and development of tools (molds) in cooperation with our third-party
contract manufacturers of our next generation of multi-handset Pay N’ Talk
phones and multi-handset broadband phones.

are offering will be approximately $20.3 million, after deducting the
underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters fully
exercise the over-allotment option, we estimate that our net proceeds from this
offering will be approximately $23.7 million, after deducting the underwriting
discount and estimated offering expenses.

We intend to use the majority of the net proceeds from this offering, together
with interest thereon, our existing cash and cash equivalents (which were
approximately $18.9 million as of September 30, 2005 on a pro forma basis), and
cash from existing and projected new collaborations, commercial agreements and
grants, to fund research and development activities, including approximately 35%
to 45% to fund the clinical development of Troxatyl up to and including the
filing of an NDA with the FDA for accelerated approval of Troxatyl for the
third-line treatment of AML, which we currently anticipate to be approximately
$29.0 million, including approximately $8.0 million which we plan to use to
complete our pivotal Phase II/III clinical trial of Troxatyl, approximately
$10.0 million which we plan to use in connection with related Troxatyl
development activities, and $11.0 million which may be payable as milestone
payments to Shire, and approximately 35% to 45% to fund the further development
of our research programs and initial clinical development stemming from our
internal programs. However, due to the risks inherent in the clinical trial
process and given the early stage of development of our programs, we are unable
to estimate with any certainty the total costs or when we will incur these costs
in the continued development of our product candidates for potential
commercialization. We anticipate existing collaborations, commercial agreements
and grants will provide approximately $6.0 million to $8.0 million of additional
proceeds in 2005 and approximately $18.0 million in 2006. We anticipate that the
net proceeds from this offering, together with interest thereon, our existing
cash and cash equivalents, and cash from existing and projected new
collaborations, commercial agreements and grants, will be sufficient to enable
us to file an NDA with the FDA for accelerated approval of Troxatyl for the
third-line treatment of AML. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of
certainty which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborative or
licensing arrangements, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and
to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital
requirements.

We anticipate using approximately 15% to 25% of the net proceeds from this
offering, together with interest thereon, our existing cash and cash
equivalents, and cash from existing and projected new collaborations, commercial
agreements and grants, for working capital and general corporate purposes. In
particular, we expect to allocate approximately 5% to 15% of such proceeds and
cash resources for increased general and administrative expenses, approximately
5% to 15% for increased costs associated with potential further expansion of our
employee base and facilities, and up to approximately 5% to 10% to repay a
portion of our debt under our line of credit and equipment financing agreement
with Silicon Valley Bank and Oxford Finance Corporation. This debt arrangement
allows us to borrow up to $8.0 million for general working capital and $2.0
million for equipment and leasehold improvements. The debt bears interest at the
rate of approximately 10% per annum and is due in monthly installments over
three years. We currently have $8.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under
this facility which is being used for general working capital and $867,000 used
for equipment purchases.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for potential acquisition and
in-licensing activities. In particular, we may acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary
technologies or products. To the degree that we pursue any of these
transactions, the amount of proceeds that we have available for working capital
and general corporate purposes may decrease. We have no present plans or
commitments relating to any of these types of transactions. Pending the use of
the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest these funds in
short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade securities.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with interest
thereon, our existing cash and cash equivalents, and cash from existing and
projected new collaborations, commercial agreements and grants, will be
sufficient to meet our projected operating requirements into the second quarter
of 2007."

common stock we are offering will be approximately $30.9 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, we estimate that net proceeds to us from this offering will be
approximately $35.7 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to fund our clinical trials, to fund
operations and to provide working capital. We intend to use the net proceeds of
this offering as follows:

†   approximately $18 million to advance our needle-free travelers’ diarrhea       
    vaccine patch through Phase 2 clinical trials prior to the initiation of       
    Phase 3 trials;                                                                
   
†   approximately $16 million to advance our IS patch through Phase 2 clinical     
    trials prior to the initiation of Phase 3 trials; and                          
   
†   approximately $5 million to advance our needle-free flu vaccine patch through  
    its next Phase 1/2 clinical trial.                                             

We will have a shortfall of approximately $8.1 million for the intended uses
above. We will need to raise additional money to fully fund the intended uses
above and may seek to do so by: (1) out-licensing technologies or products to
one or more corporate partners, (2) completing an outright sale of assets,
(3) securing debt financing and/or (4) selling additional equity securities.
As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our research,
development and commercialization efforts, the progress of our clinical trials,
and our operating costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we will retain
the discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering among the
identified uses described above, and we reserve the right to change the
allocation of the net proceeds among the uses described above as a result of
contingencies such as the progress and results of our clinical trials and our
research and development activities, the results of our commercialization
efforts, competitive developments and our manufacturing requirements.
Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds in

——————

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee and NASD
filing fee and approximately $285,241 of legal and accounting fees, have been
paid from the loans we received from our officers and directors described below.
These funds will be repaid only upon consummation of a business combination or
earlier solely from interest in excess of $750,000 earned on the trust account.

(2) Rodman & Renshaw, LLC has agreed to deposit 4.0% of the gross proceeds ($0.32
per unit) attributable to the underwriters’ discount into the trust account
until the earlier of the consummation of a business combination or the
liquidation of the trust account. They have further agreed to forfeit any rights
to, or claims against, such proceeds unless we successfully consummate a
business combination.

(3) Includes the approximately $340,000 of prior loans and $160,000 of loans to be
made upon consummation of this offering, which amounts are payable only upon
consummation of a business combination or earlier solely from interest in excess
of $750,000 earned on the trust account.

$45,877,500 or $52,647,871 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, New York, New York, as trustee. Additionally, $1,970,000 or $2,265,500
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount will be deposited in the trust
account. Rodman & Renshaw, LLC has agreed that such amounts will be distributed
to the public stockholders in the event of liquidation. The proceeds held in
trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. Other than up to
$1,250,000 of the interest income that may be released to us to fund our working
capital requirements and repay management loans, the proceeds held in the trust
account (exclusive of any funds held for the benefit of Rodman & Renshaw, LLC)
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business, other than amounts held in trust for the
benefit of Rodman & Renshaw, LLC for its services as representative of the
underwriters, or amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid
for any fees or costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing
made in connection with the business combination. We do not currently have any
agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or professional
fees. If we agree to pay such fees in the future, such fees shall be negotiated
on an arms-length basis.

The payment to Phoenix Capital Partners, LLC, an affiliate of Ramesh Akella, our
President, Chief Strategy Officer and a member of our board of directors, of a
monthly fee of $5,000 is for certain administrative, technology and secretarial
services, as well as the use of certain limited office space in New York City.
This arrangement is being agreed to by Phoenix Capital Partners, LLC for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Akella compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in New York
City, that the fee charged by Phoenix Capital Partners, LLC is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion
of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to
pay this monthly fee.

We have estimated the costs related to the acquisition of a target business will
be approximately $600,000; approximately $300,000 to identify and research
prospective target businesses and approximately $300,000 for costs related to
the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to structure
the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the related proxy
statement. Only $100,000 of the funds available outside the trust have been
allocated for such purposes and we intend to fund the balance, as well as
amounts that may exceed our current estimates and reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below, from a portion of the interest
earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account. We have agreed with
Rodman & Renshaw, LLC that the interest earned on the trust account (net of
taxes payable) up to a maximum of $1,250,000 will be released to us to fund our
working capital requirements and repay up to $500,000 of management loans. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capital
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop, standstill” provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as a
down payment or to fund a “no-shop, stand-still” provision would be determined
based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our
available funds at the time. In the event that such deposit were large enough
(thereby depleting enough of our non-trust fund assets) or in the event we were
ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of
the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a
sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the trust account to
conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding another suitable
business combination without securing additional financing. It is possible that
our existing stockholders could advance us the additional required funds,
thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be
reimbursed following a business combination. If we were unable to secure
additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business
combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance
the operations of the target business which may include subsequent acquisitions.

As of the date of this prospectus, our officers and directors have advanced to
us a total of $340,464 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC and NASD registration fee,
legal fees and expenses. Such loans will be payable with 4% annual interest upon
the consummation of a business combination, subject to earlier repayment solely
to the extent of interest in excess of $750,000 earned on the trust account (net
of taxes payable).

The proceeds of this offering (including that portion of the proceeds
attributable to the deferred underwriters’ discount) held in the trust account
and the proceeds of the management working capital loans not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above, will be invested only in United
States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the
United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from investment of these
net proceeds during this period (net of taxes payable) will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

Provided $750,000 of interest earned on the trust account is released to us, we
believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Except for an option to purchase a number of units as would maintain the
respective ownership percentages of the existing stockholders in the event that
the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised, and for the administrative
services fee, no compensation of any kind (including any finder’s and/or
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us, prior to or in connection with,
the consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To
the extent that such expenses exceed the available funds not deposited in the
trust account or released to us, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be
reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. These
reimbursements may be paid from the $50,000 initially allocated for due
diligence. Other than the agreement with Phoenix Capital Partners, LLC,
described above, there are no current agreements or understandings with any of
our existing stockholders or any of their respective affiliates with respect to
the payment of compensation of any kind subsequent to a business combination.
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest, net of taxes payable and interest previously released to
us, earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of
our liquidation as a result of our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time, or if that public stockholder were to seek to redeem
such shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us and
assuming no exercise of the over-allotment option, will be approximately
US$81.2 million, based on the initial offering price of US$18.00 per ADS shown
on the front cover of this prospectus. We will not receive any of the proceeds
from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

    The principal purposes of our offering are to:

   •  create a public market for our ordinary shares (in the form of ADSs) for   
      the benefit of all our shareholders;                                       
  
   •  attract and retain qualified employees with our share options; and         
  
   •  raise funds to expand our operations as described below.                   

    We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for the following
purposes:

   •  to invest in our continuing research and development of RF technology and  
      our new products;                                                          
  
   •  to expand our production capacity;                                         
  
   •  to expand and strengthen our sales, marketing and distribution network;    
  
   •  to construct new research and development and production facilities in     
      Shenzhen High Technology Industrial Park; and                              
  
   •  any remaining amount to be applied for working capital and other general

      installation fees, payment of operating expenses and tax payments.         

    If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we presently
intend to use the additional net proceeds payable to us for working capital and
other general corporate purposes. Pending use of any net proceeds, we intend to
invest such net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing deposits with licensed
banks or financial institutions. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale
of additional ADSs by the selling shareholders when the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option.

    The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering payable to us based upon our
present plans and business conditions. However, our management will have
significant flexibility and discretion in applying such net proceeds from this
offering."

$16.6 million, after deducting approximately $2.4 million in underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
Underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full, then we estimate that
the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $19.3 million.

    We intend to use approximately $5.4 million to $7.4 million of the net
proceeds from this offering to fund capital expenditures, operating expenses and
working capital related to the expansion of our information reporting services
in Canada. This amount includes capital expenditures of up to approximately
$2.4 million for the purchase of five additional helicopters and other studio
broadcast equipment.

    In connection with the Share Exchange, we issued an aggregate of
$1.4 million in Share Exchange Notes to the former shareholders of The Australia
Traffic Network. The Share Exchange Notes, which are intended to cover the
estimated tax consequences to such shareholders of the Share Exchange, are
non-interest bearing and will become due and payable on the closing date of this
offering. We expect to use $1.4 million of the net proceeds to repay outstanding
amounts under the Share Exchange Notes.

    Each executive officer, director, and five percent stockholder to whom we
have issued a Share Exchange Note, and the principal amount of each such Share
Exchange Note, is set forth below:

        Metro Networks Communications, Inc.    $               253,679.00  

    We intend to use the remaining net proceeds of approximately $7.8 million to
$9.8 million for general working capital and corporate purposes.
    As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of
the particular uses for the net proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we
will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of actual
expenditures may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, such as
the availability of debt financing on terms advantageous to us, the pace of our
growth in existing markets, opportunities for expansion into new markets through
acquisition or otherwise, the need to supplement, repair or replace significant
items of capital equipment and the amount of cash otherwise used by operations.
If our growth in existing markets occurs more quickly than we expect, we may use
more of the net proceeds to fund purchases of additional capital equipment,
including helicopters and fixed wing aircraft, as well as to support increased
payroll demands. If we are presented with acquisition opportunities either in
new or existing Australian, Canadian or international markets, we may apply a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering to fund such acquisitions.
Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying the
net proceeds from this offering. Until we use the net proceeds of the offering,
we intend to invest them in short term, interest-bearing securities.

    We believe the proceeds of the offering, along with anticipated cash
generated from operations and the availability of debt financing, will be
sufficient to support our operations for the next 12 months and into the
foreseeable future. We currently have no commitments in place for additional
debt financing."

common stock that we are offering will be approximately $114.2 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
that we must pay. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, we estimate that our net proceeds from this offering will be approximately
$132.0 million.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following:

        º approximately $52.8 million to redeem from investment funds affiliated
          with TA Associates and our other preferred stockholders all of the
          shares of redeemable preferred stock to be outstanding immediately
          following the conversion of our series A convertible preferred stock
          and our series B convertible preferred stock; and

        º approximately $61.4 million to repay amounts owed under the term loan
          portion of our senior credit facility with BNP Paribas.

    The senior credit facility, which consists of a $45.0 million revolving line
of credit and a $150.0 million term loan, expires on December 8, 2011. The
initial loans under the credit facility bear interest as determined by the
applicable London interbank offer rate, or LIBOR, plus 3.00%, or the prime rate
as announced by BNP Paribas, or the Prime Rate, plus 2.0%, at our election. In
addition, we are required to pay a commitment fee of 0.5% based on the
calculation of the excess of the revolving credit loan commitment over the
revolving outstanding balance as defined. Principal repayments of $375,000 are
required on a quarterly basis through 2010. The remaining principal balance at
the end of 2010 is repayable in equal quarterly installments during 2011.

    We borrowed the entire $150.0 million term loan upon the closing of the
credit facility on December 8, 2005, and used such amounts to:

        º repay and retire all $45.6 million outstanding under our prior senior
          credit facility;

        º repay all $31.5 million owed pursuant to our then outstanding
          subordinated notes and senior subordinated notes, which notes were
          held principally by investment funds affiliated with TA Associates and
          Stephen M. Lamando;

        º pay a $1.69 per share dividend to our holders of preferred stock,
          including principally investment funds affiliated with TA Associates,
          for an aggregate dividend payment of $55.85 million; and

        º pay $13.25 million to Stephen M. Lamando, Brian Kramer and Peter
          Krell, or the Clayton Founders, in satisfaction of an earn-out
          arrangement entered into in connection with the August 2004
          acquisition of Clayton, of which Mr. Lamando received $10.7 million.

    The payment of the dividend of $55.85 million to our preferred stockholders
reduced the aggregate redemption amount that otherwise would have been paid to
such preferred stockholders upon the completion of this offering by the same
amount."

promissory note to Wendy’s in the principal amount of US$960.0 million. In
February 2006, we entered into our credit facilities, incurring indebtedness of
$500.0 million under the term loan portion of our senior bank facility and our
bridge loan facility. We used the net proceeds of that indebtedness together
with available cash to pay approximately US$427.4 million in principal and
approximately US$12.7 million in interest under our promissory note to Wendy’s.

    We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 29,000,000 shares of
common stock in this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$728.2 million ($838.6 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full), at an initial public offering price of $27.00 (US$23.162) per
share of common stock. We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the remaining balance of the note payable to Wendy’s and for
general corporate purposes."

Pending use of the net proceeds, we intend to invest our net proceeds in
short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade obligations. These investments
may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences
of an investment in our ordinary shares. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for U.S. federal income taxpayers, which
could result in negative tax consequences to you."

(1)  Excludes the payment of $100 by CRT Capital Group LLC for its purchase
     option, proceeds, if any, from the sale of units under the purchase option
     and proceeds, if any, from the exercise of any warrants.

(2)  As of March 17, 2006, approximately $119,000 of the offering expenses
     had been paid from the funds we received from Messrs. Levine, de Jonge,
     Lauricella and Strenger and Ms. Butler, including $37,689 for the SEC
     registration fee in connection with the registration of our common stock in
     this offering, $4,473 for the additional SEC registration fee in respect of
     the D&O rights to purchase D&O warrants and the underlying shares of the
     common stock for the D&O warrants, $32,521 for the related NASD
     registration fee, $3,800 for the additional NASD registration fee in
     respect of the D&O rights to purchase D&O warrants and the underlying
     shares of the common stock for the D&O warrants, $24,000 to BDO Seidman,
     LLP for accountants' fees, $10,300 for Blue Sky filing fees, $5,000 for the
     AMEX initial application fee and other miscellaneous expenses already
     incurred. The loans provided by these directors and officers will be repaid
     upon consummation of this offering out of the proceeds of this offering.

(3)  The underwriters have agreed to defer a portion of their underwriting
     discount equal to 2.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or 
     $2.5 million ($2.875 million if the over-allotment option
     is exercised in full), until the consummation of our initial business
     combination. Upon an initial business combination, we will pay such
     deferred fees to the underwriters out of the proceeds of this offering held
     in the trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, NA maintained by JPMorgan
     Chase Bank, NA, acting as trustee, less $0.20 for each share of our common
     stock that our public stockholders elect to convert in connection with our
     initial business combination. The underwriters will not be entitled to any
     interest accrued on the deferred fees.

(4)  Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of our directors and
     officers for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this
     offering.

(5)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
     items may differ from those set forth herein.

(6)  Includes the $1.7 million proceeds from the issuance and sale of the D&O
     rights to be held in the trust account.

         The net proceeds of $91.4 million (or $105.1 million if the
 over-allotment option is exercised in full) and the $1.7 million
proceeds from the issuance and sale of the D&O rights in the private placement,
together with the 2.5% deferred underwriting discount, totaling $95.6
million, or approximately $7.65 per unit, will be placed in the trust account.
The amount will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The net proceeds held
in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. We may elect
not to use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a business
combination, either because the consideration for the business combination is
less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion of the
consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. However, the aggregate
fair market value of our initial business combination must equal at least 80% of
our net assets at the time of the business combination. In that event, after an
initial business combination, we may use the proceeds held in the trust account,
as well as any other net proceeds not expended, for general corporate purposes,
which may include, but are not limited to, incremental capital expenditures,
payment of any additional expenses, including financial advisory fees to third
parties, that we may incur in connection with the initial business combination,
for increases in working capital, for increasing the size of our staff or for
sales and marketing expenses and/or administrative expenses. After consummation
of the initial business combination, we may also seek to acquire additional
businesses using all or a portion of any remaining proceeds, borrowings,
proceeds from the issuance of debt or equity securities, debt or equity
securities and internally generated cash.

         We will pay Ampton a monthly fee of $10,000 for general and
administrative services, including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. Ampton is an affiliate of three of our five directors. We believe that,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York metropolitan area,
the fee charged by Ampton is at least as favorable as we could have obtained
from an unaffiliated third party.

         No compensation of any kind, including finder's and consulting fees,
will be paid to any of our directors, officers, existing stockholders or any of
their affiliates, other than the payment in connection with the general and
administrative services arrangement, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the initial business combination. However, our directors and
officers will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as participating in this
offering process, identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of our directors and
officers after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

         We intend to use our proceeds not held in trust plus up to $1,000,000
of the interest earned on the trust account for expenses incurred in
investigating, structuring and negotiating a business combination, legal and
accounting fees relating to SEC reporting obligations, administrative fees for
office space and working capital. The amount budgeted for working capital
includes premiums for director and officer liability insurance (approximately
$500,000), with the balance of working capital being held in reserve for other
expenses, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
our directors and officers in connection with activities on our behalf.

         On the first day of each quarter commencing July 2006, half of the
interest earned during the preceding quarter on the amounts held in the trust
account (net of taxes payable) will be released to us to fund a portion of our
working capital requirements, up to an aggregate of $1,000,000. We believe that
the amount allocated to working capital, together with the interest earned on 
the trust account that is available to us, will be sufficient to cover the 
costs related to the acquisition of a target business.

         We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our directors and officers and may include engaging
market research, valuation firms and actuaries as well as other third party
consultants. None of our directors and officers will receive any compensation
for their due diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket
expenses they may incur on our behalf while performing due diligence of
prospective target businesses. Any reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses would
occur at our discretion. To the extent the out-of-pocket expenses exceed the
available proceeds not deposited in the trust account plus the interest earned
on the trust account available to us, the out-of-pocket expenses would not be
reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. In addition, we
may opt to make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection
with structuring and negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved
any specific amounts for these payments or fees, which may have the effect of
reducing the amount available for payment of ongoing expenses and reimbursement
of out-of-pocket expenses.

         Messrs. Levine, de Jonge, Lauricella and Strenger and Ms. Butler have
loaned a total of $150,000 to us for the payment of offering expenses. The loans
will be payable on the earlier of August 12, 2006 or upon the consummation of
this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds used to pay offering
expenses.

         The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for
the purposes set forth above will be invested only in money market funds meeting
conditions of the 1940 Act and/or securities issued or guaranteed by the United
States so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the 1940 Act.
The interest income derived from investment of the net proceeds not held in
trust during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

         We anticipate that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the
report of BDO Seidman, LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
contains an explanatory paragraph regarding our ability to continue as a going
concern, and we have no revenues from our operations.

         The amount of available proceeds is based on management's estimates of
the costs needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to consummate
a business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate, especially if a
portion of the available proceeds is used to made a down payment or pay
exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business combination or if we
expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in pursuit of a business
combination that is not consummated. If we do not have sufficient proceeds
available to fund our expenses, we may be forced to obtain additional financing,
either from our directors and officers or from third parties. We may not be able
to obtain additional financing and our existing stockholders, our directors and
officers are not obligated to provide any additional financing. If we do not
have sufficient proceeds and cannot find additional financing, we may be forced
to liquidate prior to consummating a business combination.

         A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable) only in the event of our liquidation upon our
failure to complete a business combination or if that public stockholder were to
seek to convert the shares into cash in connection with a business combination
which the public stockholder previously voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

million from our sale of shares of common stock in this offering, after
deducting estimated offering expenses of approximately $1.3 million, that
includes $0.4 million of offering expenses paid by us on behalf of the selling
shareholders, and the underwriting discount. At the initial public offering
price of $14.00 per share, the selling stockholders will receive $18.2 million
from their sale of 1,400,000 shares of common stock in this offering, after
deducting the underwriting discount. We will not receive any portion of the net
proceeds received by the selling stockholders from the sale of their shares.
None of the net proceeds to us will be paid to our affiliates. If the
underwriters exercise their overallotment option in full, we will receive an
additional $7.8 million in net proceeds.

The principal purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our
common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public capital markets and
to provide us with flexibility in the future, including the flexibility to
acquire additional businesses, products or technologies either with the net
proceeds from this offering or through the publicly traded common stock we
create through this offering. We have no present intention to acquire any such
businesses, products or technologies. We intend to use the net proceeds of this
offering for general corporate purposes, including working capital and capital
expenditures. Capital expenditures may include the expansion of our facilities.
Prior to using the net proceeds from this offering for these purposes, we intend
to invest the funds in liquid, interest bearing, investment grade securities.

Management’s plans for the proceeds of this offering are subject to change due
to unforeseen cash requirements. We cannot specify with certainty the particular
uses for the net proceeds to be received upon completion of this offering.
Accordingly, our management team will have broad discretion in using the net
proceeds of this offering."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC and NASD registration  
      fees and an aggregate of approximately $147,000 for a portion of accounting, 
      legal and printing expenses and other offering related expenses, have been   
      paid from the $200,000 we borrowed from our directors, as further described  
      below. These funds will be repaid out of the net proceeds of this offering   
      not being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.                

(2)   Includes $1,500,000 ($1,725,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in 
      full) deferred and held in trust.                                            

(3)   Includes $200,000 deferred and held in trust.

(4)   Includes $57,500 deferred and held in trust.

$47,780,000, or $54,947,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the net proceeds, which includes the additional
underwriters’ discount and commissions of $1,500,000, or $1,725,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full and deferred legal and
printing fees of $257,500 that will be payable out of the funds held in trust
upon the consummation of a business combination, will be placed in a trust
account at Northern Trust Corporation maintained by Corporate Stock Transfer,
Inc., as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation,
except that to the extent the trust account earns interest or we are deemed to
have earned income in connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek
disbursements from the trust account to pay any federal, state or local tax
obligations related thereto. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used
as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
ultimately complete a business combination and to pay the additional
underwriting discount to the underwriters and other deferred expenses upon the
consummation of a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to
the sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the
target business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of
directors at that time.

Upon the consummation of this offering, certain of our directors and
stockholders have agreed to enter into a limited recourse revolving line of
credit agreement with us pursuant to which we may have up to $750,000 of
outstanding borrowings at any time. The loans made under the limited recourse
revolving line of credit will bear an interest rate no greater than the interest
rate payable on the proceeds of this offering held in trust. The loans made
under the limited recourse revolving line of credit will be due upon the
consummation of a business combination, and interest will accrue but will not be
payable unless we complete a business combination. In the event we do not
consummate a business combination within two years of the completion of this
offering, the loans made under the limited recourse revolving line of credit
will not be repaid by us and the directors and stockholders making such loans
will have no claims for payment thereunder. There can be no assurance that these
directors and stockholders will have the financial resources available to meet
their commitments to provide the additional working capital as the obligations
thereunder come due under the terms of the limited recourse revolving line of
credit. The funds we receive from our directors and stockholders under the terms
of the limited recourse revolving line of credit will not be held in trust and
will only be used for the payment of expenses relating to the due diligence of
potential target businesses, deposits, down payments or funding of “no-shop”
provisions in connection with a particular business combination, for working
capital and for general corporate purposes. If any of the directors and
stockholders who commit to provide the additional working capital to us after
the closing of this offering fails to do so, such failure could have a material
adverse effect on the financial condition of our company, and as a result, we
may be unable to consummate a business combination.

We estimate expenses following the consummation of this offering as set forth in
the following table:

(1)   For purposes of this table, we are assuming the company will borrow the      
      maximum funds available under the limited recourse revolving line of credit. 

(2)   Payment of $5,500 of the administrative fees per month will be deferred and  
      shall be payable upon the consummation of a business combination. In the     
      event we must liquidate our company, these fees will not be paid with        
      proceeds of this offering held in trust.                                     

(3)   Reflects the agreement of certain of our directors and stockholders under    
      which we may borrow up to $750,000 outstanding at any time pursuant to a     
      limited recourse revolving line of credit following the closing of this      
      offering and the deferral of $132,000 of administrative fees that will be    
      payable upon the consummation of a business combination or the liquidation of
      our company from funds not otherwise held in trust.                          

We have agreed to pay Windy City, Inc., an affiliated third party of which Mr.
Kanter is president and a director, $7,500 per month for office space, utilities
and personnel. Windy City, Inc. has agreed to defer the payment of $5,500 per
month of the administrative fees until the consummation of a business
combination or the liquidation of our company. In the event we must liquidate
our company, these fees will not be paid with proceeds of this offering held in
trust.

Pursuant to the terms of a warrant purchase agreement with Morgan Joseph & Co.,
Mr. Kanter, our President and Secretary, or his designees, has agreed to
purchase in the open market up to $300,000 of our warrants at a price per
warrant not to exceed $1.20. These purchases of market purchase warrants will
occur during the 40 trading day period beginning the later of the date separate
trading of the common stock and the warrants begins or 60 days after the end of
the “restricted period” under Regulation M promulgated by the SEC. Our other
existing stockholders have agreed to serve as designees of Mr. Kanter with
respect to this warrant purchase commitment. They have agreed to purchase in the
open market some of the warrants that Mr. Kanter is required to purchase. These
market purchase warrants will not be sold by Mr. Kanter, the existing
stockholders or his designees until the consummation of a business combination;
however, they may be able to transfer such market purchase warrants in certain
limited circumstances, such as by will in the event of their death, but the
transferees receiving such market purchase warrants will be subject to the same
sale restrictions imposed on Mr. Kanter and/or his designees. While Mr. Kanter
and/or his designees are committed to purchase up to $300,000 of our warrants in
the open market, there is no restriction or limitation that prevents any of them
from acquiring more than $300,000 of our warrants in the open market.

Prior to the closing of a business combination, we have agreed to obtain key
person life insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 in the aggregate on the lives
of certain members of our management for a three year period. The premium for
such life insurance policy, of which we will be the sole beneficiary, is
expected to be approximately $5,000 per year per individual.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $237,000 after
payment of approximately $115,000 of director and officer liability premiums)
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses
will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors and may include
engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and
directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of
prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities. We believe that the excess working capital will be
sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working capital
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination, although we do not have any current
intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit
such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such
payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital
available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other
expenses related to finding another suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. As used in this prospectus, a
“no-shop provision” means a contractual provision that prohibits the parties in
a business combination from engaging in certain actions such as soliciting
better offers or other transactions prior to the completion of the business
combination or the termination thereof and requires, in the event of a breach of
such provision, the breaching party to make a monetary payment to the
non-breaching party. In the case of a buyer of the business, such a provision
can impose liquidated damages on the buyer if the buyer fails to consummate the
business combination transaction in certain circumstances resulting in the
forfeiture of any deposit.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to pay the
additional underwriting discount to the underwriters and to finance the
operations of the target business.

Upon consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be paid an
additional $1,500,000, or $1,725,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option
is exercised in full, consisting of an underwriting discount in the amount of 3%
of the gross proceeds of this offering and legal counsel and the financial
printer will be paid their deferred fees of $200,000 and $57,500, respectively,
out of the funds held in trust. Such additional amounts payable to the
underwriters, legal counsel and the financial printer would not be affected by
any amounts depleted from the trust account due to stockholders voting against
the business combination and exercising their conversion rights into their pro
rata portion of the trust account. Such additional amounts will also not be
deducted from the available trust account balance in determining the amounts to
be paid to stockholders exercising their conversion rights. We believe that
placing a portion of the underwriting discount into the trust account which will
be payable only upon consummation of a business combination demonstrates
confidence in our ability to consummate a business combination and further
aligns the underwriters’ interests with those of our investors by having a
portion of their compensation be at risk in the event that we are unable to
consummate a business combination.

As of the date of this prospectus, Messrs. Burleson, Pendergest, and Brukardt,
Dr. Clemow, Dr. Martin, Windy City, Inc. and Chicago Investments, Inc. have
loaned us a total of $200,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses
of this offering, such as transfer agency fees, SEC registration fees, NASD
registration fees and legal and accounting fees and expenses. The $25,000 loan
from Mr. Burleson will be payable without interest on the earlier of June 23,
2006 or the consummation of the offering. The $25,000 loan from Windy
City, Inc. will be payable without interest on the earlier of July 8, 2006 or
the consummation of the offering. The $22,500 loan from Mr. Pendergest will be
payable without interest on the earlier of July 11, 2006 or the consummation of
the offering. The $25,000 loan from Dr. Martin will be payable without interest
on the earlier of July 15, 2006 or the consummation of the offering. The $15,000
loan from Dr. Clemow will be payable without interest on the earlier of July 22,
2006 or the consummation of the offering. The $10,000 loan from Mr. Brukardt
will be payable without interest on the earlier of July 28, 2006 or the
consummation of the offering. The $13,750 loan from Windy City, Inc. and the
$13,750 loan from Mr. Burleson will be payable without interest on the earlier
of September 26, 2006 or the consummation of the offering. The $25,000 loan from
Chicago Investments, Inc. will be payable without interest on the earlier of
January 4, 2007 or the consummation of the offering, and the $25,000 loan from
Mr. Burleson will be payable without interest on the earlier of January 17, 2007
or the consummation of the offering.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. We believe that, upon consummation of
this offering, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least
the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated
during that time.

Other than the $7,500 per month fee to Windy City, Inc. described above, $5,500
of which is being deferred until completion of our initial business combination,
no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. After the
consummation of a business combination, if any, to the extent our management
remains as officers of the resulting business, we anticipate that they may enter
into employment agreements, the terms of which will be negotiated and which we
expect to be comparable to employment agreements with other similarly-situated
companies in the healthcare industry. Further, after the consummation of a
business combination, if any, to the extent our directors remain as directors of
the resulting business, we anticipate that they will receive compensation
comparable to directors at other similarly-situated companies in the healthcare
industry.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust account)
only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares
into cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account. The term public stockholders means the holders of common stock sold as
part of the units in this offering or in the open market, including any existing
stockholders to the extent that they purchase or acquire such shares."

(1)  Excludes the $100 purchase price for the purchase option issued to ThinkEquity
     Partners LLC, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and   
     proceeds from exercise of any warrants.                                       
    
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received  
     in the form of a loan from Acquicor Management LLC, as described below. These 
     funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in 
     the trust account upon consummation of this offering.                         
    
(3)  Excludes deferred underwriting fees equal to 2.0% of the gross proceeds from  
     the sale of the units to the public stockholders, or $3,000,000 ($3,450,000 if
     the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which the      
     underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial       
     business combination. 

(4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these    
     items may differ substantially from those set forth herein.                   
    
(5)  These expenses include any reimbursements made to our officers, directors and 
     special advisors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in performing due
     diligence, as well as any potential fees that we may pay to third parties,    
     such as market research firms and other consultants, that perform due         
     diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to the extent such   
     fees are paid by our officers, directors and special advisors on our behalf   
     and such officers, directors and special advisors are reimbursed in the amount
     and to the extent of such fees).                                              
    
(6)  The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of    
     Acquicor Management LLC and our directors, officers and special advisors for  
     out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this offering.             

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses. Our efforts in identifying prospective target
businesses will be limited to the technology, multimedia and networking sectors.

    Of the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement,
$142,933,004, or $164,308,004 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. We expect to use
$3,000,000, or $3,450,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in
full, of proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferred underwriting
fees, up to $750,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable on such interest) to cover our operating expenses and the remaining
proceeds held in the trust account to acquire one or more domestic and/or
foreign operating businesses in the technology, multimedia and networking
sectors. However, we may not use all of such proceeds in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance the operations of the
target businesses. While it is difficult to determine what the specific
operating expenses of a target business may entail, we expect that they may
include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, general ongoing
expenses including overhead and payroll, expanding markets and strategic
acquisitions or alliances. In addition, after consummation of a business
combination, we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to
satisfy any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers,
directors and special advisors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar
fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.

    The remaining $750,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account and up
to $750,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable on
such interest) may be used to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination, as described below. Interest earned on the
trust account and not released to us as described above will be held in the
trust account for use in completing a business combination or released to
investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or upon liquidation.

    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers, directors and special advisors and may
include engaging market research and valuation firms, as well as other
third-party consultants. None of our officers, directors or special advisors
will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while
performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. Any reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. There is no limit on the
amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us and there will be no review
of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of
directors, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of
competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination.

    Acquicor Management LLC has agreed to provide us with office space,
utilities and secretarial support without charge until we consummate a business
combination.

    We have reserved approximately $200,000 for premiums for director and
officer insurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved
approximately $285,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes and $60,000
for the payment of annual listing fees to be paid to the American Stock
Exchange. We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $360,000)
for other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations. For
example, we may opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or
similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating a business
combination. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of
professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the
future to assist us in locating suitable acquisition candidates, in which event
we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation. We have not reserved any
specific amounts for a deposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finder’s fees or
similar fees or compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the
available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing
expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To
the extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees or
compensation unless we consummate a business combination. In addition, the
excess working capital will be used to cover other insurance premiums and
miscellaneous expenses that we have not yet identified.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private
placement, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time. However, the report of BDO Seidman, LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, contains an explanatory paragraph stating that our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the consummation of this
offering. The amount of available proceeds is based on management’s estimate of
the amount needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate,
especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a deposit or
down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business
combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in
pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do not have
sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our management, our existing stockholders or
third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and neither
our management nor any of our existing stockholders is obligated to provide any
additional financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination.

    Acquicor Management LLC has loaned a total of $275,000 to us for the payment
of offering expenses. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3.6% per year and
will be payable on the earlier of August 25, 2006 or the consummation of this
offering. The loan was repaid out of a portion of the proceeds from the private
placement.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, or securities issued or guaranteed by the United States so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended. The interest income earned on investment of the net
proceeds not held in the trust account during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our officers,
directors, special advisors or stockholders or any entity with which they are
affiliated, any finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with a business combination. However, our officers,
directors and special advisors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying potential target operating
businesses and performing due diligence in connection with suitable business
combinations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses
reimbursable by us and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the
expenses by anyone other than our board of directors, which
includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of competent
jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination. In addition, we intend to retain our existing
management and enter into employment or other compensation arrangements with
them following our initial business combination, the terms of which have not yet
been determined. Despite our current intention to retain our existing
management, and our existing management’s current intention to remain actively
involved with our business and operations in a management role following our
initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our existing management
will be retained in any significant role, or at all, and we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to them if they are retained
following a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable on the interest income of the funds in the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

(1)  Excludes the $100 purchase price for the purchase option issued to ThinkEquity
     Partners LLC, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and   
     proceeds from exercise of any warrants.                                       
    
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received  
     in the form of a loan from Acquicor Management LLC, as described below. These 
     funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in 
     the trust account upon consummation of this offering.                         
    
(3)  Excludes deferred underwriting fees equal to 2.0% of the gross proceeds from  
     the sale of the units to the public stockholders, or $3,000,000 ($3,450,000 if
     the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which the      
     underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial       
     business combination. 

(4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these    
     items may differ substantially from those set forth herein.                   
    
(5)  These expenses include any reimbursements made to our officers, directors and 
     special advisors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in performing due
     diligence, as well as any potential fees that we may pay to third parties,    
     such as market research firms and other consultants, that perform due         
     diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to the extent such   
     fees are paid by our officers, directors and special advisors on our behalf   
     and such officers, directors and special advisors are reimbursed in the amount
     and to the extent of such fees).                                              
    
(6)  The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of    
     Acquicor Management LLC and our directors, officers and special advisors for  
     out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this offering.             

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses. Our efforts in identifying prospective target
businesses will be limited to the technology, multimedia and networking sectors.

    Of the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement,
$142,933,004, or $164,308,004 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. We expect to use
$3,000,000, or $3,450,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in
full, of proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferred underwriting
fees, up to $750,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable on such interest) to cover our operating expenses and the remaining
proceeds held in the trust account to acquire one or more domestic and/or
foreign operating businesses in the technology, multimedia and networking
sectors. However, we may not use all of such proceeds in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance the operations of the
target businesses. While it is difficult to determine what the specific
operating expenses of a target business may entail, we expect that they may
include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, general ongoing
expenses including overhead and payroll, expanding markets and strategic
acquisitions or alliances. In addition, after consummation of a business
combination, we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to
satisfy any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers,
directors and special advisors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar
fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.

    The remaining $750,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account and up
to $750,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable on
such interest) may be used to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination, as described below. Interest earned on the
trust account and not released to us as described above will be held in the
trust account for use in completing a business combination or released to
investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or upon liquidation.

    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers, directors and special advisors and may
include engaging market research and valuation firms, as well as other
third-party consultants. None of our officers, directors or special advisors
will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while
performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. Any reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. There is no limit on the
amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us and there will be no review
of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of
directors, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of
competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination.

    Acquicor Management LLC has agreed to provide us with office space,
utilities and secretarial support without charge until we consummate a business
combination.

    We have reserved approximately $200,000 for premiums for director and
officer insurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved
approximately $285,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes and $60,000
for the payment of annual listing fees to be paid to the American Stock
Exchange. We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $360,000)
for other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations. For
example, we may opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or
similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating a business
combination. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of
professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the
future to assist us in locating suitable acquisition candidates, in which event
we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation. We have not reserved any
specific amounts for a deposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finder’s fees or
similar fees or compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the
available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing
expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To
the extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees or
compensation unless we consummate a business combination. In addition, the
excess working capital will be used to cover other insurance premiums and
miscellaneous expenses that we have not yet identified.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private
placement, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time. However, the report of BDO Seidman, LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, contains an explanatory paragraph stating that our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the consummation of this
offering. The amount of available proceeds is based on management’s estimate of
the amount needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate,
especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a deposit or
down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business
combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in
pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do not have
sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our management, our existing stockholders or
third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and neither
our management nor any of our existing stockholders is obligated to provide any
additional financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination.

    Acquicor Management LLC has loaned a total of $275,000 to us for the payment
of offering expenses. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3.6% per year and
will be payable on the earlier of August 25, 2006 or the consummation of this
offering. The loan was repaid out of a portion of the proceeds from the private
placement.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, or securities issued or guaranteed by the United States so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended. The interest income earned on investment of the net
proceeds not held in the trust account during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our officers,
directors, special advisors or stockholders or any entity with which they are
affiliated, any finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with a business combination. However, our officers,
directors and special advisors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying potential target operating
businesses and performing due diligence in connection with suitable business
combinations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses
reimbursable by us and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the
expenses by anyone other than our board of directors, which
includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of competent
jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination. In addition, we intend to retain our existing
management and enter into employment or other compensation arrangements with
them following our initial business combination, the terms of which have not yet
been determined. Despite our current intention to retain our existing
management, and our existing management’s current intention to remain actively
involved with our business and operations in a management role following our
initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our existing management
will be retained in any significant role, or at all, and we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to them if they are retained
following a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable on the interest income of the funds in the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

(1)  Excludes the $100 purchase price for the purchase option issued to ThinkEquity
     Partners LLC, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and   
     proceeds from exercise of any warrants.                                       
    
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received  
     in the form of a loan from Acquicor Management LLC, as described below. These 
     funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in 
     the trust account upon consummation of this offering.                         
    
(3)  Excludes deferred underwriting fees equal to 2.0% of the gross proceeds from  
     the sale of the units to the public stockholders, or $3,000,000 ($3,450,000 if
     the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), which the      
     underwriters have agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial       
     business combination. 

(4)  These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these    
     items may differ substantially from those set forth herein.                   
    
(5)  These expenses include any reimbursements made to our officers, directors and 
     special advisors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in performing due
     diligence, as well as any potential fees that we may pay to third parties,    
     such as market research firms and other consultants, that perform due         
     diligence of a target business on our behalf (other than to the extent such   
     fees are paid by our officers, directors and special advisors on our behalf   
     and such officers, directors and special advisors are reimbursed in the amount
     and to the extent of such fees).                                              
    
(6)  The not yet identified miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of    
     Acquicor Management LLC and our directors, officers and special advisors for  
     out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this offering.             

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses. Our efforts in identifying prospective target
businesses will be limited to the technology, multimedia and networking sectors.

    Of the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement,
$142,933,004, or $164,308,004 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The
proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. We expect to use
$3,000,000, or $3,450,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised in
full, of proceeds held in the trust account to pay the deferred underwriting
fees, up to $750,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes
payable on such interest) to cover our operating expenses and the remaining
proceeds held in the trust account to acquire one or more domestic and/or
foreign operating businesses in the technology, multimedia and networking
sectors. However, we may not use all of such proceeds in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because we finance
a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In
that event, the remaining proceeds held in the trust account, as well as any
other net proceeds not expended, will be used to finance the operations of the
target businesses. While it is difficult to determine what the specific
operating expenses of a target business may entail, we expect that they may
include some or all of the following: capital expenditures, general ongoing
expenses including overhead and payroll, expanding markets and strategic
acquisitions or alliances. In addition, after consummation of a business
combination, we may use any remaining proceeds held in the trust account to
satisfy any unpaid reimbursable out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers,
directors and special advisors, as well as any unpaid finder’s fees or similar
fees or compensation to the extent such expenses, fees or compensation exceed
the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account.

    The remaining $750,000 of net proceeds not held in the trust account and up
to $750,000 of the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable on
such interest) may be used to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination, as described below. Interest earned on the
trust account and not released to us as described above will be held in the
trust account for use in completing a business combination or released to
investors upon exercise of their conversion rights or upon liquidation.

    We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be
performed by some or all of our officers, directors and special advisors and may
include engaging market research and valuation firms, as well as other
third-party consultants. None of our officers, directors or special advisors
will receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while
performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. Any reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our discretion. There is no limit on the
amount of out-of-pocket expenses reimbursable by us and there will be no review
of the reasonableness of the expenses by anyone other than our board of
directors, which includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of
competent jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination.

    Acquicor Management LLC has agreed to provide us with office space,
utilities and secretarial support without charge until we consummate a business
combination.

    We have reserved approximately $200,000 for premiums for director and
officer insurance for a 24-month period. In addition, we have reserved
approximately $285,000 for the payment of corporate franchise taxes and $60,000
for the payment of annual listing fees to be paid to the American Stock
Exchange. We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $360,000)
for other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations. For
example, we may opt to make a deposit or down payment or pay exclusivity or
similar fees in connection with structuring and negotiating a business
combination. While we do not presently anticipate engaging the services of
professional firms that specialize in business acquisitions, we may do so in the
future to assist us in locating suitable acquisition candidates, in which event
we may pay a finder’s fee or other compensation. We have not reserved any
specific amounts for a deposit, down payment, exclusivity fees, finder’s fees or
similar fees or compensation, each of which may have the effect of reducing the
available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment of our ongoing
expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf. To
the extent that any such fees or compensation exceeds the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account, we would not be able to pay such fees or
compensation unless we consummate a business combination. In addition, the
excess working capital will be used to cover other insurance premiums and
miscellaneous expenses that we have not yet identified.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering and the private
placement, we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the
next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during
that time. However, the report of BDO Seidman, LLP, our independent registered
public accounting firm, contains an explanatory paragraph stating that our
ability to continue as a going concern is dependent on the consummation of this
offering. The amount of available proceeds is based on management’s estimate of
the amount needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to
consummate a business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate,
especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to make a deposit or
down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business
combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in
pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do not have
sufficient proceeds available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain
additional financing, either from our management, our existing stockholders or
third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing, and neither
our management nor any of our existing stockholders is obligated to provide any
additional financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination.

    Acquicor Management LLC has loaned a total of $275,000 to us for the payment
of offering expenses. The loan bears interest at a rate of 3.6% per year and
will be payable on the earlier of August 25, 2006 or the consummation of this
offering. The loan was repaid out of a portion of the proceeds from the private
placement.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940, as amended, or securities issued or guaranteed by the United States so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940, as amended. The interest income earned on investment of the net
proceeds not held in the trust account during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

    Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our officers,
directors, special advisors or stockholders or any entity with which they are
affiliated, any finder’s fee or other compensation for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with a business combination. However, our officers,
directors and special advisors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying potential target operating
businesses and performing due diligence in connection with suitable business
combinations. There is no limit on the amount of out-of-pocket expenses
reimbursable by us and there will be no review of the reasonableness of the
expenses by anyone other than our board of directors, which
includes persons who may seek reimbursement, or a court of competent
jurisdiction if such reimbursement is challenged. To the extent such
out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust
account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we
consummate a business combination. In addition, we intend to retain our existing
management and enter into employment or other compensation arrangements with
them following our initial business combination, the terms of which have not yet
been determined. Despite our current intention to retain our existing
management, and our existing management’s current intention to remain actively
involved with our business and operations in a management role following our
initial business combination, we cannot assure you that our existing management
will be retained in any significant role, or at all, and we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to them if they are retained
following a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable on the interest income of the funds in the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust account."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the initial investment
    we received from our initial securityholders.                                

(2) The $250,000 allocated to legal, accounting and other expenditures of        
    structuring and negotiating a business combination are amounts we expect to  
    pay to attorneys and accountants that we retain throughout the process of    
    structuring and negotiating a business combination, including the due        
    diligence, merger negotiations and regulatory filings and approvals.         

$46,460,000 or $53,429,000, if the representative’s over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers Inc. maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,
New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust fund
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the proceeds to our Class B stockholders. The proceeds held in
the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination.

We expect that due diligence of prospective target companies will be undertaken
and coordinated by our officers and directors. Our officers and directors may,
depending on the nature of the proposed transaction and the target’s assets,
hire industry specialists, market research firms, third party consultants or
others to assist with the due diligence process, and we have estimated that
approximately $250,000 (set forth under the line item entitled “Due diligence” 
(excluding accounting and legal due diligence) of prospective target businesses) 
may be spent in connection with such due diligence. Such amount will also be 
used to reimburse officers, directors and existing stockholders for their 
out-of-pocket expenses for due diligence.

The payment to Good Harbor Consulting, LLC, an affiliate of Richard A. Clarke,
our Chairman, and Roger W. Cressey, our Vice Chairman, and John S. Tritak, a
member of our Board of Directors, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and administrative
support. This arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Messrs. Clarke, Cressey or Tritak with compensation in lieu of a salary. We
believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the Arlington
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Good Harbor Consulting, LLC is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.

We intend to use approximately $150,000 of the working capital allocation for
director and officer liability insurance premiums and hold the balance of
$440,000, or $697,175 if the representative’s over-allotment option is exercised
in full, in reserve in case due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our officers
and directors in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. In
addition, although we have no present intention to do so, we could in the future
find it necessary or desirable to use a portion of the net proceeds not held in
trust to make a down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in
letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping” around for
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
businesses) with respect to a particular business combination. If so, any such
amount would be based on the terms of the specific business combination and the
amount of our available funds at the time. If we use a portion of our funds for
such a purpose and the related business combination does not occur and we are
required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the
agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we could, if such
payment was large enough and we had already used up the funds allocated to due
diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted transaction, be
left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or conduct due diligence
with respect to, other potential target businesses. The use of a portion of the
funds to make a down payment or fund a no-shop provision increases the
possibility that our officers and directors will be called upon to ensure that
the proceeds in the trust fund are not reduced by the claims of vendors or other
entities that are owed money by us.  

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund that are not used for such purpose, as well as any other net proceeds not
expended, will be used to finance the operations of the target business.
 
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued within the meaning
of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of
180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions of
paragraphs (c)(2), (c)(3) and (c)(4) of Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 which are treated as “cash items” as the term is
used under Rule 3a-1 of the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Good Harbor Consulting, LLC
the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our initial securityholders, including our officers and directors, or
any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order 
to effecuate, the business combination. However, they will receive reimbursement 
for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities 
on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing 
due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent the proceeds 
held outside of the trust account are insufficient to reimburse our directors, 
officers and securityholders for out-of-pocket-expenses, these out-of-pocket 
expenses, if any, would be treated as advances to us, and we would be obligated 
to repay them following a business combination. Since the role of present 
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to 
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a 
business combination.

A Class B stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event there is no business combination or if that Class B stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the Class B stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a Class B stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund. Further, our initial
securityholders, including our officers and directors, have agreed to vote any
shares of Class B common stock held by them, whether acquired by them upon
purchase of Series B units in this offering or in the open market, in favor of a
proposed business combination approved by our board of directors. Under no
circumstances will holders of common stock have any right or interest of any
kind to or in the trust fund."

are offering will be approximately $86.5 million, or approximately
$100.5 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses that we must pay. We will not receive any of the
proceeds of the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholder. The
selling stockholder is an entity controlled by our chief executive officer in
which our chief operating officer, among others, has a pecuniary interest. 

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following:
   •  approximately $31.3 million to repurchase from TA Associates all of the     
      senior subordinated notes to be outstanding immediately following the       
      conversion of the senior subordinated convertible notes;                    
  
   •  $32.5 million to redeem from TA Associates all of the shares of redeemable  
      preferred stock to be outstanding immediately following the conversion of   
      the series A convertible preferred stock; and                               
  
   •  the balance of net proceeds for general corporate purposes, including       
      working capital and possible acquisitions and investments.                  

    TA Associates holds a controlling interest in us. One of our directors,
Mr. Child, is a managing director of TA Associates, Inc. 

    The senior subordinated convertible notes mature on September 30, 2009 and
bear interest at a rate of 12% per annum. The proceeds from the issuance of
these senior subordinated convertible notes were used to redeem outstanding
shares of common stock from holders of our common stock on September 30, 2003.

    Management will have significant discretion in applying the balance of our
net proceeds from this offering. We currently have no agreements or commitments
with respect to any acquisitions or investments and we do not currently have any
acquisitions or investments planned. Pending specific application of our net
proceeds, we plan to invest our net proceeds in government securities and other
short-term, investment-grade, marketable securities."

stock in this offering will be approximately $38.7 million, or approximately
$44.9 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full,
based on the initial public offering price of $8.00 per share and after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us.

We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:
     • approximately $14.0 million for preclinical and clinical testing of AZ-001;   
    
     • approximately $11.0 million for preclinical and clinical testing of AZ-002;   
    
     • approximately $7.5 million for preclinical and clinical testing of AZ-004;    
    
     • approximately $5.5 million for preclinical and clinical testing of AZ-003; and
    
     • the balance for working capital and other general corporate expenses.         

We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition of, or
investment in, product candidates, technologies or companies that complement our
business, although we have no current understandings, commitments or agreements
to do so.

As of December 31, 2005, we had $38.4 million in cash, cash equivalents and
short-term marketable securities and $3.2 million available under an equipment
line of credit. We believe that our existing capital resources and the net
proceeds from this offering will be sufficient to enable us to maintain
currently planned operations through at least the next 18 months. We do not
expect our existing capital resources and the net proceeds from this offering to
be sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development of any of
our product candidates. However, we expect that during the next 18 months we
will be able to:

     • complete a Phase IIb clinical trial and commence a Phase III clinical    
       trial for AZ-001;                                                        
    
     • complete Phase IIa clinical trials and commence a Phase IIb clinical     
       trial for each of AZ-002 and AZ-004; and                                 
    
     • complete a Phase I clinical trial for AZ-003.                            

We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and
to develop our product candidates.

The actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to
risk and may change depending upon the clinical indication targeted, the
development strategy pursued and the results of preclinical studies and earlier
clinical trials. The amounts and timing of other expenditures will depend upon
numerous factors, including the status of our product development and
commercialization efforts, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this
offering, competition, manufacturing, activities and any strategic partnerships
arrangements we may enter into. As a result, our management will have broad
discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we will invest the
net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing investment grade and
U.S. government securities."

(1)  º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Messrs. Feinberg and Liffmann as described below. These funds
     will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering used to pay the
     offering expenses.

(2)  º This amount excludes additional underwriting fees equal to 2% of the gross
     proceeds of the unit offering, or $2,400,000, which the underwriters have
     agreed to defer until the consummation of our initial business combination.
     Upon the consummation of our initial business combination, we will pay such
     deferred fees (less $0.16 for each share of common stock converted to cash
     in connection with our initial business combination) to the underwriters
     out of the proceeds of this offering held in a trust account at Lehman
     Brothers Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
     acting as trustee.

(3)  º Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of our existing
     stockholders, officers and directors for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
     connection with the offering.

(4)  º The total net proceeds includes an aggregate of $1,000,000 payable
     immediately prior to this offering by Messrs. Feinberg and Liffmann for the
     purchase in a private placement of 833,334 founding director warrants.

    We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units and the founding
director warrants to acquire an operating business in the healthcare industry.

    Of the net proceeds from our unit offering, $113,500,000 will be placed in a
trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc., maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business
combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be
used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we
ultimately complete a business combination. Additionally, although we have no
present intention to do so, it is possible that we will in the future find it
necessary or desirable to use a portion of these funds to make a down payment or
deposit or fund a lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision, with respect to a potential
business combination. If so, any such amount would be based on the terms of the
specific transaction and the amount of available funds at the time. If we use 
a significant portion of our funds for such a purpose and we are required to 
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating 
to the original payment or otherwise), we could, if such payment was large 
enough and we had already used some or all of the funds allocated to due 
diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted transaction, 
be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or to conduct 
due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses.
In that event, we may be required to liquidate before the completion of a
business combination. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will
be used to pay the underwriters a deferred fee equal to 2% of the gross proceeds
of the unit offering, or $2,400,000, less $0.16 for each share of common stock
converted to cash in connection with our initial business combination, upon the
consummation of our initial business combination; this portion of the proceeds
held in the trust account will not be available for our use to acquire an
operating business. We may not use all of the remaining proceeds in the trust
account in connection with a business combination, either because the
consideration for the business combination is less than the proceeds in the
trust account or because we finance a portion of the consideration with our
capital stock or debt securities. In that event, the proceeds held in the trust
account, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, may be used to finance
the operations of the target business, which may include subsequent
acquisitions.

    We have agreed to pay Oracle Investment Management, Inc., an affiliate of
Mr. Feinberg, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative services,
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe that,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the area surrounding our offices
in Greenwich, Connecticut, the fee charged by Oracle Investment Management, Inc.
is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third
party.

    All of the gross proceeds from the sale of the founding director warrants,
approximately $1,000,000, will not be placed in trust or used to pay offering
expenses, but rather will be available for our use. We intend to use the excess
working capital (approximately $340,000) for premiums for director and officer
liability insurance (approximately $240,000), with the balance of $100,000 being
held in reserve for other expenses of structuring and negotiating our initial
business combination, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by our existing stockholders, officers and directors in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due diligence of a
prospective target business will be performed by some or all of our officers,
directors and existing stockholders and may include engaging market research and
valuation firms, as well as other third-party consultants. None of our officers,
directors or existing stockholders will receive any compensation for their due
diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they
may incur on our behalf while performing due diligence of a prospective target
business. Any reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses would occur at our
discretion. To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available
proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would
not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business combination. In
addition, we may opt to make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees
in connection with structuring and negotiating a business combination. While we
do not presently anticipate engaging the services of professional firms that
specialize in business acquisitions, other than CRT Capital Group LLC, to which
we have granted a right of first refusal for all investment banking services
through the later of (i) one year from the closing of our initial business
combination, if any, or (ii) two years from the closing of this offering, we may
do so in the future, in which event we may pay a finder's fee or other
compensation. We have not reserved any specific amounts for a down payment,
exclusivity fees, finder's fees or similar fees or compensation, each of which
may have the effect of reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account for payment of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses incurred on our behalf.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the amount of available
proceeds from the sale of the founding director warrants, approximately
$1,000,000, will be sufficient to operate for at least the next 24 months,
assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

The amount of available proceeds is based on management's estimate of the amount
needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and to consummate a
business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate, especially if a
portion of the available proceeds is used to make a down payment or pay
exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business combination or if we
expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in pursuit of a business
combination that is not consummated. If we do not have sufficient proceeds
available to cover our expenses, we may be forced to obtain additional
financing, either from our existing stockholders, officers and directors or
third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional financing and our
existing stockholders, officers and directors are not obligated to provide any
additional financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds and cannot find
additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to consummating a
business combination.

    Messrs. Feinberg and Liffmann have each loaned $50,000 to us for the payment
of offering expenses. Each loan is non-interest bearing and will be payable on
the earlier of September 22, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. Each
loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering used to pay the
offering expenses.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in U.S. ""government securities,""
defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States government having a
maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, or any open ended investment
company registered under the Investment Company Act of 1940 that holds itself
out as a money market fund and bears the highest credit rating issued by a
United States nationally recognized rating agency. By restricting the investment
of the proceeds to these instruments, we intend to meet the requirements for the
exemption provided in Rule 3a-1 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of
1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act of 1940. The interest income earned on investment of the net
proceeds not held in trust during this period will be used to defray our general
and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with
securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a
business combination is completed.

    Neither we nor any other person or entity will pay any of our officers,
directors or existing stockholders or any entity with which they are affiliated,
any finders fee or other compensation for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with a business combination. However, our existing stockholders,
officers and directors will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
participating in the offering process, identifying a potential target operating
business and performing due diligence on a suitable business combination. We
have not reserved any specific amount for such payments, which may have the
effect of reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for
payment of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses
incurred on our behalf. In addition, since the role of present management after
a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account, including the amount representing the deferred portion of the
underwriters' fee, in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete
a business combination within 18 months after consummation of this offering (or
within 24 months after the consummation of this offering if a letter of intent,
agreement in principle or definitive agreement has been executed within
18 months after consummation of this offering and the business combination
relating thereto has not yet been consummated within such 18-month period). A
public stockholder will also be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account, including the amount representing the deferred portion of the
underwriters' fee, if that public stockholder were to convert shares into cash
in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right to or interest of any kind in the trust
account.

    In the event of our liquidation, as described above, our existing
stockholders, officers and directors will be entitled to receive funds from the
trust account solely with respect to any shares of common stock which they
purchased in or following this offering."

     proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.    
                              
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
     from Mr. Mukunda as described below. These funds will be repaid out of the   
     proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
     offering.                                    
                                
(3)  Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. has agreed to deposit the non-accountable expense  
     allowance ($0.18 per Unit) into the trust account until the earlier of the   
     completion of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust account.
     They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to or claims against such     
     proceeds unless we successfully complete a business combination.   
          
(4)  The $300,000 ($414,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is 
     expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside professionals to  
     conduct due diligence once a potential target for a business combination is  
     identified and to assist in negotiating and structuring the ultimate business
     transaction. The $185,000 represents costs expected to be incurred by the    
     Company and its officers, directors and employees in identifying and         
     reviewing potential targets for business combinations.       
                
(6)  Excludes a financial advisory fee payable to Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. equal 
     to two percent (2%) of the consideration of any business combination by us up
     to a maximum fee of $1,500,000, a portion of which shall be allocated to SG  
     Americas Securities, LLC.                             
                       
(7)  The working capital of up to $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if the over-allotment    
     option is exercised in full) will be funded from the interest earned from    
     monies in escrow. At closing the founders will loan the company $720,000 and 
     extend the pre-IPO loans of $150,000, for an aggregate amount of $870,000    
     which will be deposited in the trust account. Certain vendors have agreed to 
     defer an aggregate of $105,000 of expenses. These will be repaid from the    
     interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans will be repaid with  
     4% interest from the interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans 
     and the vendor deferrals will not have any access or rights against the      
     principal in escrow.                               
                          
(8)  Excludes $1,769,400 which represents the underwriters’ non-accountable       
     expense allowance and which is further described in footnote 3.              

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses with primary operations in India.

    $55,441,200, or $63,845,850 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at United Bank maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Additionally, $1,769,400 of the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance
will be deposited in the trust account. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
businesses, other than amounts held in trust or paid to Ferris, Baker Watts,
Inc. for its services as representative of the underwriters as financial advisor
(including the $1,500,000 maximum financial advisory fee described above),
amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in
connection with the business combination. The Company does not currently have
any agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or
professional fees. If the Company agrees to pay such fees in the future, such
fees shall be negotiated on an arms-length basis. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of a target business may entail,
we expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital
expenditures, expenditures for future projects, general ongoing expenses
including supplies and payroll, expanding markets and strategic acquisitions or
alliances.

    We have agreed to pay Integrated Global Networks, LLC or IGN, LLC, an
affiliate of Mr. Mukunda, a monthly fee of $4,000 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This
arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Mukunda, the
Chief Executive Officer of IGN, LLC and our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and President, with compensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by IGN, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated third party. However, because our directors may not be deemed
“independent”, we did not have the benefit of disinterested directors approving
the transaction.

    We intend to use the working capital (approximately $1,855,000) ($2,150,000
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) for repayment
of founders loans, deferred expenses, director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve for other expenses such as,
travel to India, due diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations, and deposits, down payments
and/or funding of a “no shop” provision in connection with a business
combination as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we financed a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

    Mr. Mukunda has loaned a total of $100,000 to us for the payment of offering
expenses. Dr. Krishna has loaned a total of $50,000 to us for the payment of
offering expenses. Upon the consummation of this offering, the founders will
loan an additional $720,000 to us which will be deposited in the trust account.
Each loan bears interest at a rate of 4% per year and will be payable on the
earlier of the first anniversary of the consummation of this offering or the
consummation of a business combination. Prior to the release of the escrowed
funds to us each loan will be solely repaid out of the interest earned on the
escrowed funds, provided that we will not be required to make any payments from
such interest until we have withdrawn an aggregate of $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) from such
interest for working capital purposes.

    The net proceeds of this offering (including that portion of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
held in the trust account) that are not immediately required
for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income
derived from investment of the net proceeds not held in trust during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    We intend to allocate $185,000 of the interest paid on the trust proceeds
for expenses incurred in examining and evaluating prospective target businesses.
Mr. Mukunda will supervise this process and we expect that he will devote
substantially all of his time to our business once we have signed a term sheet
with a target business. We anticipate that Mr. Mukunda will be assisted in his
efforts by the officers and advisors of the Company, together with the Company’s
outside attorneys, accountants and other representatives. Other than IGN, LLC,
we will not pay compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, stockholders or special
advisors or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or
in connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, our
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination. However, other
than the agreement with IGN, LLC described above, there are no current
agreements or understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any
kind subsequent to a business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from
the $185,000 allocated for due diligence.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance held in trust and
any accrued interest thereon. In the event that we are unable to consummate a
business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,
the underwriters have agreed to the following: (i) forfeit any rights or claims
to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) that the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public shareholders along with
any accrued interest thereon."

(1)  Excludes the payment of $100 from Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. for its purchase 
     option, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and        
     proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.    
                              
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
     from Mr. Mukunda as described below. These funds will be repaid out of the   
     proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
     offering.                                    
                                
(3)  Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. has agreed to deposit the non-accountable expense  
     allowance ($0.18 per Unit) into the trust account until the earlier of the   
     completion of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust account.
     They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to or claims against such     
     proceeds unless we successfully complete a business combination.   
          
(4)  The $300,000 ($414,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is 
     expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside professionals to  
     conduct due diligence once a potential target for a business combination is  
     identified and to assist in negotiating and structuring the ultimate business
     transaction. The $185,000 represents costs expected to be incurred by the    
     Company and its officers, directors and employees in identifying and         
     reviewing potential targets for business combinations.       
                
(6)  Excludes a financial advisory fee payable to Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. equal 
     to two percent (2%) of the consideration of any business combination by us up
     to a maximum fee of $1,500,000, a portion of which shall be allocated to SG  
     Americas Securities, LLC.                             
                       
(7)  The working capital of up to $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if the over-allotment    
     option is exercised in full) will be funded from the interest earned from    
     monies in escrow. At closing the founders will loan the company $720,000 and 
     extend the pre-IPO loans of $150,000, for an aggregate amount of $870,000    
     which will be deposited in the trust account. Certain vendors have agreed to 
     defer an aggregate of $105,000 of expenses. These will be repaid from the    
     interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans will be repaid with  
     4% interest from the interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans 
     and the vendor deferrals will not have any access or rights against the      
     principal in escrow.                               
                          
(8)  Excludes $1,769,400 which represents the underwriters’ non-accountable       
     expense allowance and which is further described in footnote 3.              

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses with primary operations in India.

    $55,441,200, or $63,845,850 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at United Bank maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Additionally, $1,769,400 of the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance
will be deposited in the trust account. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
businesses, other than amounts held in trust or paid to Ferris, Baker Watts,
Inc. for its services as representative of the underwriters as financial advisor
(including the $1,500,000 maximum financial advisory fee described above),
amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in
connection with the business combination. The Company does not currently have
any agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or
professional fees. If the Company agrees to pay such fees in the future, such
fees shall be negotiated on an arms-length basis. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of a target business may entail,
we expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital
expenditures, expenditures for future projects, general ongoing expenses
including supplies and payroll, expanding markets and strategic acquisitions or
alliances.

    We have agreed to pay Integrated Global Networks, LLC or IGN, LLC, an
affiliate of Mr. Mukunda, a monthly fee of $4,000 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This
arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Mukunda, the
Chief Executive Officer of IGN, LLC and our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and President, with compensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by IGN, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated third party. However, because our directors may not be deemed
“independent”, we did not have the benefit of disinterested directors approving
the transaction.

    We intend to use the working capital (approximately $1,855,000) ($2,150,000
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) for repayment
of founders loans, deferred expenses, director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve for other expenses such as,
travel to India, due diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations, and deposits, down payments
and/or funding of a “no shop” provision in connection with a business
combination as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we financed a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

    Mr. Mukunda has loaned a total of $100,000 to us for the payment of offering
expenses. Dr. Krishna has loaned a total of $50,000 to us for the payment of
offering expenses. Upon the consummation of this offering, the founders will
loan an additional $720,000 to us which will be deposited in the trust account.
Each loan bears interest at a rate of 4% per year and will be payable on the
earlier of the first anniversary of the consummation of this offering or the
consummation of a business combination. Prior to the release of the escrowed
funds to us each loan will be solely repaid out of the interest earned on the
escrowed funds, provided that we will not be required to make any payments from
such interest until we have withdrawn an aggregate of $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) from such
interest for working capital purposes.

    The net proceeds of this offering (including that portion of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
held in the trust account) that are not immediately required
for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income
derived from investment of the net proceeds not held in trust during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    We intend to allocate $185,000 of the interest paid on the trust proceeds
for expenses incurred in examining and evaluating prospective target businesses.
Mr. Mukunda will supervise this process and we expect that he will devote
substantially all of his time to our business once we have signed a term sheet
with a target business. We anticipate that Mr. Mukunda will be assisted in his
efforts by the officers and advisors of the Company, together with the Company’s
outside attorneys, accountants and other representatives. Other than IGN, LLC,
we will not pay compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, stockholders or special
advisors or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or
in connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, our
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination. However, other
than the agreement with IGN, LLC described above, there are no current
agreements or understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any
kind subsequent to a business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from
the $185,000 allocated for due diligence.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance held in trust and
any accrued interest thereon. In the event that we are unable to consummate a
business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,
the underwriters have agreed to the following: (i) forfeit any rights or claims
to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) that the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public shareholders along with
any accrued interest thereon."

(1)  Excludes the payment of $100 from Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. for its purchase 
     option, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and        
     proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.    
                              
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
     from Mr. Mukunda as described below. These funds will be repaid out of the   
     proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
     offering.                                    
                                
(3)  Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. has agreed to deposit the non-accountable expense  
     allowance ($0.18 per Unit) into the trust account until the earlier of the   
     completion of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust account.
     They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to or claims against such     
     proceeds unless we successfully complete a business combination.   
          
(4)  The $300,000 ($414,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is 
     expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside professionals to  
     conduct due diligence once a potential target for a business combination is  
     identified and to assist in negotiating and structuring the ultimate business
     transaction. The $185,000 represents costs expected to be incurred by the    
     Company and its officers, directors and employees in identifying and         
     reviewing potential targets for business combinations.       
                
(6)  Excludes a financial advisory fee payable to Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. equal 
     to two percent (2%) of the consideration of any business combination by us up
     to a maximum fee of $1,500,000, a portion of which shall be allocated to SG  
     Americas Securities, LLC.                             
                       
(7)  The working capital of up to $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if the over-allotment    
     option is exercised in full) will be funded from the interest earned from    
     monies in escrow. At closing the founders will loan the company $720,000 and 
     extend the pre-IPO loans of $150,000, for an aggregate amount of $870,000    
     which will be deposited in the trust account. Certain vendors have agreed to 
     defer an aggregate of $105,000 of expenses. These will be repaid from the    
     interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans will be repaid with  
     4% interest from the interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans 
     and the vendor deferrals will not have any access or rights against the      
     principal in escrow.                               
                          
(8)  Excludes $1,769,400 which represents the underwriters’ non-accountable       
     expense allowance and which is further described in footnote 3.              

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses with primary operations in India.

    $55,441,200, or $63,845,850 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at United Bank maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Additionally, $1,769,400 of the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance
will be deposited in the trust account. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
businesses, other than amounts held in trust or paid to Ferris, Baker Watts,
Inc. for its services as representative of the underwriters as financial advisor
(including the $1,500,000 maximum financial advisory fee described above),
amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in
connection with the business combination. The Company does not currently have
any agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or
professional fees. If the Company agrees to pay such fees in the future, such
fees shall be negotiated on an arms-length basis. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of a target business may entail,
we expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital
expenditures, expenditures for future projects, general ongoing expenses
including supplies and payroll, expanding markets and strategic acquisitions or
alliances.

    We have agreed to pay Integrated Global Networks, LLC or IGN, LLC, an
affiliate of Mr. Mukunda, a monthly fee of $4,000 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This
arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Mukunda, the
Chief Executive Officer of IGN, LLC and our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and President, with compensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by IGN, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated third party. However, because our directors may not be deemed
“independent”, we did not have the benefit of disinterested directors approving
the transaction.

    We intend to use the working capital (approximately $1,855,000) ($2,150,000
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) for repayment
of founders loans, deferred expenses, director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve for other expenses such as,
travel to India, due diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations, and deposits, down payments
and/or funding of a “no shop” provision in connection with a business
combination as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we financed a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

    Mr. Mukunda has loaned a total of $100,000 to us for the payment of offering
expenses. Dr. Krishna has loaned a total of $50,000 to us for the payment of
offering expenses. Upon the consummation of this offering, the founders will
loan an additional $720,000 to us which will be deposited in the trust account.
Each loan bears interest at a rate of 4% per year and will be payable on the
earlier of the first anniversary of the consummation of this offering or the
consummation of a business combination. Prior to the release of the escrowed
funds to us each loan will be solely repaid out of the interest earned on the
escrowed funds, provided that we will not be required to make any payments from
such interest until we have withdrawn an aggregate of $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) from such
interest for working capital purposes.

    The net proceeds of this offering (including that portion of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
held in the trust account) that are not immediately required
for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income
derived from investment of the net proceeds not held in trust during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    We intend to allocate $185,000 of the interest paid on the trust proceeds
for expenses incurred in examining and evaluating prospective target businesses.
Mr. Mukunda will supervise this process and we expect that he will devote
substantially all of his time to our business once we have signed a term sheet
with a target business. We anticipate that Mr. Mukunda will be assisted in his
efforts by the officers and advisors of the Company, together with the Company’s
outside attorneys, accountants and other representatives. Other than IGN, LLC,
we will not pay compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, stockholders or special
advisors or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or
in connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, our
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination. However, other
than the agreement with IGN, LLC described above, there are no current
agreements or understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any
kind subsequent to a business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from
the $185,000 allocated for due diligence.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance held in trust and
any accrued interest thereon. In the event that we are unable to consummate a
business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,
the underwriters have agreed to the following: (i) forfeit any rights or claims
to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) that the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public shareholders along with
any accrued interest thereon."

(1)  Excludes the payment of $100 from Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. for its purchase 
     option, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and        
     proceeds from the exercise of any warrants.    
                              
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
     from Mr. Mukunda as described below. These funds will be repaid out of the   
     proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
     offering.                                    
                                
(3)  Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. has agreed to deposit the non-accountable expense  
     allowance ($0.18 per Unit) into the trust account until the earlier of the   
     completion of a business combination or the liquidation of the trust account.
     They have further agreed to forfeit any rights to or claims against such     
     proceeds unless we successfully complete a business combination.   
          
(4)  The $300,000 ($414,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) is 
     expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside professionals to  
     conduct due diligence once a potential target for a business combination is  
     identified and to assist in negotiating and structuring the ultimate business
     transaction. The $185,000 represents costs expected to be incurred by the    
     Company and its officers, directors and employees in identifying and         
     reviewing potential targets for business combinations.       
                
(6)  Excludes a financial advisory fee payable to Ferris, Baker Watts, Inc. equal 
     to two percent (2%) of the consideration of any business combination by us up
     to a maximum fee of $1,500,000, a portion of which shall be allocated to SG  
     Americas Securities, LLC.                             
                       
(7)  The working capital of up to $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if the over-allotment    
     option is exercised in full) will be funded from the interest earned from    
     monies in escrow. At closing the founders will loan the company $720,000 and 
     extend the pre-IPO loans of $150,000, for an aggregate amount of $870,000    
     which will be deposited in the trust account. Certain vendors have agreed to 
     defer an aggregate of $105,000 of expenses. These will be repaid from the    
     interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans will be repaid with  
     4% interest from the interest earned from the funds held in trust. The loans 
     and the vendor deferrals will not have any access or rights against the      
     principal in escrow.                               
                          
(8)  Excludes $1,769,400 which represents the underwriters’ non-accountable       
     expense allowance and which is further described in footnote 3.              

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses with primary operations in India.

    $55,441,200, or $63,845,850 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds of this offering and the private placement
will be placed in a trust account at United Bank maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. Additionally, $1,769,400 of the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters’ non-accountable expense allowance
will be deposited in the trust account. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
businesses, other than amounts held in trust or paid to Ferris, Baker Watts,
Inc. for its services as representative of the underwriters as financial advisor
(including the $1,500,000 maximum financial advisory fee described above),
amounts paid for finders’ or professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or
costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity financing made in
connection with the business combination. The Company does not currently have
any agreement with any party with respect to the payment of finders’ or
professional fees. If the Company agrees to pay such fees in the future, such
fees shall be negotiated on an arms-length basis. While it is difficult to
determine what the specific operating expenses of a target business may entail,
we expect that they may include some or all of the following: capital
expenditures, expenditures for future projects, general ongoing expenses
including supplies and payroll, expanding markets and strategic acquisitions or
alliances.

    We have agreed to pay Integrated Global Networks, LLC or IGN, LLC, an
affiliate of Mr. Mukunda, a monthly fee of $4,000 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This
arrangement is for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Mukunda, the
Chief Executive Officer of IGN, LLC and our Chairman, Chief Executive Officer
and President, with compensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in the Washington, DC metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by IGN, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from
an unaffiliated third party. However, because our directors may not be deemed
“independent”, we did not have the benefit of disinterested directors approving
the transaction.

    We intend to use the working capital (approximately $1,855,000) ($2,150,000
if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) for repayment
of founders loans, deferred expenses, director and officer liability insurance
premiums, with the balance being held in reserve for other expenses such as,
travel to India, due diligence, legal, accounting, and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations, and deposits, down payments
and/or funding of a “no shop” provision in connection with a business
combination as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we financed a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target businesses, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

    Mr. Mukunda has loaned a total of $100,000 to us for the payment of offering
expenses. Dr. Krishna has loaned a total of $50,000 to us for the payment of
offering expenses. Upon the consummation of this offering, the founders will
loan an additional $720,000 to us which will be deposited in the trust account.
Each loan bears interest at a rate of 4% per year and will be payable on the
earlier of the first anniversary of the consummation of this offering or the
consummation of a business combination. Prior to the release of the escrowed
funds to us each loan will be solely repaid out of the interest earned on the
escrowed funds, provided that we will not be required to make any payments from
such interest until we have withdrawn an aggregate of $1,855,000 ($2,150,000 if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full) from such
interest for working capital purposes.

    The net proceeds of this offering (including that portion of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
held in the trust account) that are not immediately required
for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income
derived from investment of the net proceeds not held in trust during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    We intend to allocate $185,000 of the interest paid on the trust proceeds
for expenses incurred in examining and evaluating prospective target businesses.
Mr. Mukunda will supervise this process and we expect that he will devote
substantially all of his time to our business once we have signed a term sheet
with a target business. We anticipate that Mr. Mukunda will be assisted in his
efforts by the officers and advisors of the Company, together with the Company’s
outside attorneys, accountants and other representatives. Other than IGN, LLC,
we will not pay compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting
fees) to the Company’s directors, officers, employees, stockholders or special
advisors or their respective affiliates for services rendered to us prior to or
in connection with the consummation of the business combination. However, our
existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination. However, other
than the agreement with IGN, LLC described above, there are no current
agreements or understandings with any of our existing stockholders or any of
their respective affiliates with respect to the payment of compensation of any
kind subsequent to a business combination. These reimbursements may be paid from
the $185,000 allocated for due diligence.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance held in trust and
any accrued interest thereon. In the event that we are unable to consummate a
business combination and the trustee is forced to liquidate the trust account,
the underwriters have agreed to the following: (i) forfeit any rights or claims
to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) that the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters’ discount and non-accountable expense allowance
will be distributed on a pro-rata basis among the public shareholders along with
any accrued interest thereon."

offering based on the sale of 2,941,200 shares after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and approximately $2.0 million to pay
fees and expenses associated with this offering and the related transactions. If
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we expect to
receive approximately $54.6 million in net proceeds from this offering based on
the sale of 3,382,380 shares after deducting estimated underwriting discounts
and commissions and approximately $2.0 million to pay fees and expenses
associated with this offering and the related transactions. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay term loan amounts
under our senior credit facilities and satisfy associated accrued interest and
transaction costs. We used a portion of this indebtness to fund $92.8 million in
cash dividends to Cypress. 

The aggregate principal balance outstanding under the term loan under our senior
credit facilities was approximately $90 million as of December 30, 2005. This
balance includes $10 million in additional borrowings under our term loan made
during December 2005, which we used to partially fund a distribution to our
stockholders. No prepayment penalty or premium will apply when we use the net
proceeds of this offering to repay term loan amounts under our senior credit
facilities. The underwriters for this offering are affiliated with certain of
the lenders under our senior credit facilities.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the selling stockholders' sale of
shares of common stock in the offering."

with the working capital we need to open new service centers. After deducting
the estimated expenses of this offering, including the underwriting discount of
$1,219,725, the representative’s non-accountable expense allowance of $351,000
and other estimated offering expenses of $975,000, we estimate that the net
proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $15 million.
(Non-accountable expenses are expenses incurred by the representative in
connection with this offering that are payable out of the proceeds of the
offering, but for which it is not required to produce evidence of payment
because we have agreed to pay a fixed percentage of the gross proceeds for this
purpose.) If the representative exercises the over-allotment option in full, we
estimate that the net proceeds of the offering will be approximately $17.45
million.

   Repayment of debt. All of our outstanding indebtedness, other than a $250,000
unsecured note that we issued in March 2006, including unpaid principal and
accrued interest through the date of closing, will be repaid out of the proceeds
of this offering. At December 31, 2005, our total indebtedness, including
accrued interest was approximately $5.1 million, consisting of the following:

   º Convertible Notes having an aggregate principal amount of $1.95 million,
     bearing interest at 10%. As of December 31, 2005, the accrued interest on
     these notes was $192,000. These notes are due and payable in full on
     September 30, 2007. We have a right to prepay beginning September 30, 2006,
     at which time we expect the accrued interest will be $357,000. If these
     notes have not been converted into shares of our capital stock before we
     can prepay them, they will be repaid out of the proceeds. If the holder
     exercises its conver- sion right before we prepay, the proceeds of the
     offering that would have otherwise been used to prepay the Convertible
     Notes will be allocated to working capital.
   º Unsecured Notes in the aggregate principal amount of $1.5 million, bearing
     interest at 10%. These notes mature on August 31, 2006 but must be repaid
     out of the proceeds of this offering. As of December 31, 2005, the accrued
     interest on these notes was approximately $43,000.
   º $400,000 reflected in two unsecured notes, each in the original principal
     amount of $200,000, bearing inter- est at 10%. One note matures in July
     2006 and the other matures in October 2006. They both must be repaid out of
     the proceeds of this offering. As of December 31, 2005 the accrued interest
     on these notes was approximately $17,000. These notes are held by the
     representative.
   º $100,000 unsecured note bearing interest at 10%. The note is due and
     payable on August 31, 2006 but must be repaid out of the proceeds of this
     offering. Accrued interest through December 31, 2005 was $3,300.
   º $200,000 unsecured note bearing interest at 10%. The note matures on
     January 1, 2007 but must be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering.
     Accrued interest through December 31, 2005 was $1,000.
   º $75,000 unsecured note bearing interest at 7%. The note matures on December
     31, 2006. Accrued interest through December 31, 2005 was $12,000.
   º $40,000 reflected in two unsecured notes, one in the original principal
     amount of $25,000 and the other in the original principal amount of
     $15,000. Neither note has a stated maturity date, although, by oral agree-
     ment with the holder of the notes we agreed to repay these notes out of the
     proceeds of this offering. Both notes bear interest at 7% per annum until
     they are repaid. Accrued interest on both notes as of December 31, 2005 was
     approximately $750.
   º $175,000, reflected in two unsecured notes, one in the original principal
     amount of $100,000 and the other in the original principal amount of
     $75,000. The $100,000 note matured on October 6, 2004. The $75,000
     note does not have a stated maturity date. By oral agreement with the
     holder of these notes, the holder agreed to extend the maturity date of the
     $100,000 to the effective date of this offering and we agreed to repay both
     notes out of the proceeds of this offering. Both notes bear interest at 8%
     per annum. Accrued interest on both notes as of December 31, 2005 was
     approximately $90,000.
   º $100,000 unsecured note that was due and payable October 13, 2004. However,
     the holder of the note agreed to extend the maturity date until the
     effective date of this offering and we agreed to repay the note out of the
     proceeds of this offering. Originally the interest rate on the note was 12%
     per annum. However, as part of the agreement to extend the maturity date we
     also agreed to increase the interest rate to 18%. $100,000 unse- cured note
     bearing interest at 10% that is payable out of the proceeds of this
     offering. Accrued interest as of December 31, 2005 was approximately
     $9,500.
   º $170,000 note secured by our accounts receivable. The note bears interest
     at the rate of 3% per month and is payable as and when we collect
     receivables. To date, none of the principal amount has been repaid. Accrued
     interest as of December 31, 2005 was $5,200.
     In addition, the amount included in the table above also includes the
     following:
   º Three separate demand notes, one issued in January and two issued in
     February 2006, each in the principal amount of $50,000 and which bear
     interest at 8%.
   º A $250,000 note, bearing interest at 10% per annum and payable out of the
     proceeds of this offering or 30 days following demand for repayment. This
     note is held by the representative.
   º Approximately $112,000 of accrued interest for the first calendar quarter
     of 2006 on all of the notes that will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
     offering other than the Convertible Notes. Included in this amount is
     approximately $11,300 of accrued interest on the notes held by the
     representative.

   Region expansion and new service centers. This is the amount we anticipate
investing in new service centers over the next 12 months in regions we are
currently serving and in new regions. Over the next 12 months we anticipate
expanding into two to four new regions and opening eight to 12 new service
centers. The exact number of new regions and new service centers that we open
will ultimately depend on availability of capital, new business opportunities
and strategic relationships. New regions are more expensive to start because of
the investment in full regional infrastructure and time to initial revenue flow.
We estimate the total cash investment to open a region and operate it until it
becomes cash flow positive, including personnel, equipment and material costs
and overhead, is approximately $400,000. We estimate the total cash investment
necessary to open a new service center in a region we currently serve and
operate it until it becomes cash flow positive is approximately $150,000.

   Sales and marketing. This includes the estimated cost of an additional eight
sales and marketing personnel as well as the cost of an enhanced sales and
marketing program that will target not only builders but insurance companies,
lenders, architects and the general public. This program will include direct
sales calls, telemarketing, targeted mailing, general advertising and
appearances at trade shows and conventions.

   Capital expenditures. This amount consists primarily of property, plant and
equipment, such as computer and communications equipment, needed to support an
increase in business activity. It also includes the cost of upgrading our
accounting software should we determine that an upgrade is necessary. It does
not include any capital expenditures specifically associated with local service
centers.

   Deferred compensation. This amount consists of $240,000 of accrued but unpaid
compensation due to our chief executive officer and our chief operating officer,
as well as a lump sum payment of $120,000 due when this offering is complete to
our former president who resigned as of November 30, 2005. The accrued
compensation will be paid over a period of six months beginning 30 days after
the date of this prospectus.

   Working capital. This amount includes working capital required for our
general corporate purposes including rent, utilities, and insurance, as well as
the working capital required by our local service centers until they become cash
flow positive. A portion of this amount includes the cost of searching for and
hiring additional management personnel, including a chief financial officer, a
vice president of operations, marketing director and a director of human
resources. We may also use a portion of the proceeds allocated to working
capital for reducing our accounts payable and accrued expenses and to increase
our general liability insurance coverage. If the representative exercises the
over-allotment option, the additional net proceeds of approximately $2.45
million will be added to working capital. Similarly, if the holder of the
Convertible Notes exercises its rights to convert those notes into
stock, the amount that would have been used to repay those notes, approximately
$2.3 million, will be added to working capital.

   The above information represents our best estimate of our working capital
requirements based upon the current status of our business. We will retain broad
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds within the categories listed
above. The amounts actually expended for these purposes may vary significantly
and will depend on a number of factors, including our rate of revenue growth,
cash generated by operations, evolving business needs, changes in demand for our
services, the cost to open new service centers, our marketing efforts,
competitive developments, new strategic opportunities, general economic
conditions and other factors that we cannot anticipate at this time.

   Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in
interest-bearing, investment grade securities, or, if necessary to avoid being
designated an investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
United States government securities.

   We expect that the net proceeds from this offering, when combined with cash
flow from operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and capital
requirements for at least 12 months following this offering. We may be required
to raise additional capital through the sale of equity or other securities
sooner if our operating assumptions change or prove to be inaccurate. We cannot
assure you that any financing of this type would be available. In the event of a
capital inadequacy, we would be required to limit our growth and the
expenditures described above."

common shares (at an initial public offering price of $13.00 per common share
and after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses
payable by us) will be approximately $14.0 million. We estimate that our net
proceeds will continue to be approximately $14.0 million if the underwriters
exercise their over-allotment option in full. We presently intend to contribute
substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering to RAM Re to increase its
capital and surplus in order to increase its underwriting capacity. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of our common shares by the selling
shareholders."

of the 5,000,000 common shares offered by us in this offering, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common shares being
offered by the selling shareholders. Concurrently with the closing of this
offering we expect to borrow $90.0 million under the term loan portion of our
new credit facility. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering together
with these borrowings as follows:

   •   $140.1 million for repayment of the indebtedness outstanding under our    
       existing credit facilities and all outstanding indebtedness of WinZip;    
  
   •   $4.8 million of financing fees and expenses associated with our new credit
       facility; and                                                             
  
   •   $14.1 million for general corporate purposes, which may include           
       acquisitions.                                                             

    If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in
full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from the sale of the additional
common shares to be sold by us will be $11.2 million, all of which will be used
for general corporate purposes.

    We and our subsidiary, Corel US Holdings, LLC, entered into our existing
credit facility in February 2005, which consists of a $75.0 million first lien
term loan and a $10.0 million revolving line of credit, both maturing in
February 2010 and a $55.0 million second lien term loan maturing in August 2010.
The first lien term loan and revolving line of credit bear interest at a rate
equal to LIBOR plus 4.25% per annum. The second lien term loan bears interest at
a rate equal to LIBOR plus 8.0%. The one month LIBOR as of January 1, 2006 was
4.81%. As of November 30, 2005, we had $73.1 million and $55.0 million of
outstanding indebtedness under our first lien term loan and second lien term
loan, respectively. We used available cash and borrowings under our existing
first lien term loan and second lien term loan to fund a dividend payment and
return of capital to our shareholders totaling approximately $85.3 million, to
pay fees and expenses associated with the credit facility financing and to repay
the $56.4 million balance under our prior loan facility.

    We also intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering and
borrowings under the term loan portion of the new credit facility to repay
existing outstanding indebtedness of WinZip, which we will acquire from Vector
Capital concurrently with the closing of this offering. WinZip entered into a
credit facility in June 2005 consisting of a $23.0 million term loan and
$1.0 million revolving credit facility maturing in June 2008. The credit
facility bears interest at the prime rate plus a margin based on WinZip’s
performance. As of February 28, 2006, there was $19.2 million outstanding under
the WinZip credit facility. Borrowings under the WinZip credit facility were
used to repay an outstanding loan in the amount of $15.0 million and to
partially fund a $12.0 million cash dividend to Vector Capital in June 2005.

    The purchase price for WinZip was determined by taking into account the
respective historical and expected revenue and EBITDA contributions of us and
WinZip, as well as an assumed valuation multiple of those contributions. The
imputed value of the shares issuable in our acquisition of WinZip is
significantly higher than the price paid by Vector Capital to purchase WinZip
from an unaffiliated third party in January 2005, reflecting significant
improvements in WinZip’s business and strategies implemented at the direction of
Vector Capital, as well as incremental benefits attributable to the strategic
nature of the currently proposed transaction. For additional information
regarding Vector Capital’s acquisition of WinZip, see footnote 8 to our
consolidated financial statements. The acquisition was negotiated in the context
of a parent-subsidiary relationship and therefore may not reflect economic or
other terms that would result from an arm’s length transaction with an
unaffiliated third party.

    We will have broad discretion in the application of those proceeds of the
offering to be used for general corporate purposes and may use funds for future
acquisitions. Other than the acquisition of WinZip described above, we have no
current arrangements or commitments to acquire any specific business. Pending
their application, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest bearing
investment grade securities."

(1) As of December 31, 2005, $54,065.29 of the offering expenses have already    
    been paid from advances under the revolving credit agreement as described    
    below. These consist of $23,406.25 for the SEC registration fee, $22,640 for 
    the NASD registration fee and $8,019.04 miscellaneous expenses. In addition, 
    as of December 31, 2005, management has incurred approximately $22,000 in    
    reimbursable offering expenses that will be reimbursed by the Company        
    following completion of this offering for items such as travel, translation  
    costs, and administrative expenses.                                          

(2) Represents 4% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 12,500,000 units in 
    this offering ($4,000,000) and 4% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 
    1,875,000 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option           
    ($600,000).                                                                  

(3) Represents 3% of the gross proceeds from the sale of 12,500,000 units in this
    offering ($3,000,000) and 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of 1,875,000
    units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment ($300,000) that will be    
    paid to the underwriters only upon consummation of a business combination,   
    less $0.24 for each share converted to cash in connection with our business  
    combination. If a business combination is not consummated and we are         
    liquidated, such amounts will be distributed among our public shareholders.  
    These amounts include the non-accountable expense allowance of 1% of the     
    gross proceeds, excluding the over-allotment option.                         

(4) These amounts, along with the one-half interest on funds held in trust and   
    distributed to us each calendar quarter, are expected to be paid to legal,   
    accounting and other outside professional firms to conduct due diligence once
    a potential target for a business combination is identified and to assist in 
    negotiating, structuring, and documenting a business combination and the     
    preparation and filing of the related proxy statement.                       

$95,000,000, or $109,250,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. Of this amount, $3,000,000 (($3,300,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the
underwriters if and only if a business combination is consummated, less $0.24
for each share converted to cash in connection with our business combination.
Other than one-half of the interest income, which may be released to us each
calendar quarter to fund our working capital and general corporate requirements,
as well as to pay for the costs of outside professionals to conduct due
diligence once a potential target for a business combination is identified and
to assist in negotiating, structuring, and documenting a business combination
and the preparation and filing of the related proxy statement, the proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
(exclusive of any funds held for the benefit of the underwriters) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of
directors at that time. Because we do not have any specific business combination
under consideration and have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) had any
discussions, formal or otherwise, with respect to such a transaction, it is
impossible at this time to determine specifically how we would, following a
business combination, use any proceeds held in the trust account which are not
used to consummate such business combination.

We have agreed to pay FDC Consultants Limited, a company established under the
laws of the Hong Kong SAR, owned and managed by Franklin D. Chu, our co-chief
executive officer, $7,500 per month for office space and general and
administrative services including secretarial support. We believe that such fee
is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.
Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer
be required to pay these monthly fees.

We intend to use the excess working capital shown above for director and officer
liability insurance premiums, with the balance being held in reserve in the
event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
shareholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

To the extent that our securities are used in whole or in part as consideration
to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account as well
as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of
the target business.

Our directors, Messrs. Lo, Chu, Arculli and Polanen, and our advisor, Mr.
Ch’ien, have entered into a revolving credit agreement with us in the amount of
$125,000. Advances under the credit facility will be used to pay a portion of
the expenses related to this offering. We intend to repay these loans from the
proceeds of this offering. As of December 31, 2005, an aggregate of $59,330 has
been advanced to us under the credit facility.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation will be paid to any of our officers and directors, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing shareholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations and
for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with this offering.
Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in
trust and currently allocated in the above table “Working capital to cover
miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance and reserves.” In addition, reimbursement
for such expenses will also be paid by us out of the one-half interest on funds
held in the trust account and distributed to us each calendar quarter. To the
extent that such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust account or such interest income, such out-of-pocket
expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a business
combination, in which event this reimbursement obligation would in all
likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target business. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account not
previously released to us) only in the event of our liquidation upon our failure
to complete a business combination within the allotted time or if that public
shareholder were to seek to redeem such shares into cash in connection with a
business combination which the public shareholder voted against and which we
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

common stock in this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $34.8 million.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:
†  approximately $15 million to partially finance the construction of our second  
   manufacturing facility, out of a total estimated cost of $25 million with the  
   balance being financed by loans from commercial banks, which we believe will   
   allow us to expand our manufacturing capabilities for all of our products and  
   product candidates;                                                            
  
†  approximately $6 million to fund our plan to expand our biosurgical product    
   line and to penetrate the market for biosurgical products in Japan and other   
   countries, which we believe will allow us to register one or more of our       
   biosurgical products, including Crosseal/Quixil and Crosseal II/Quixil II,     
   independently or in collaboration with a local partner;                        
  
†  approximately $4.4 million to repay all amounts outstanding under our loan and 
   security agreement with Hercules Technology Growth Capital Inc., including the 
   prepayment penalty of 1.25%; this loan bears interest at an annual rate of     
   11.45% and matures on March 1, 2008;                                           
  
†  we may use up to $3.8 million to repay principal, accrued interest and a       
   prepayment premium of up to 100% to holders of our new convertible promissory  
   notes who demand such prepayment; these notes bear interest at an annual rate  
   of 10% and mature on December 30, 2007; and                                    
  
†  the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.          

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
acquire businesses, products or technologies that are complementary to our
current or future business and product lines, but we currently have no
commitments, agreements, or understandings relating to any of these types of
transactions.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash, cash equivalents and short-term investments, will be sufficient to meet
our projected operating requirements for at least the next 12 months.
The allocation of the net proceeds of this offering described above represents
our best current estimate of our projected operating requirements. Our
management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds and
we reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds in response to certain
contingencies such as the results of our commercialization activities,
competitive developments, opportunities to acquire or in-license products,
technologies or businesses and other factors."

common stock by us in this offering of approximately $289 million, based on an
initial public offering price of $24.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. We will
not receive any of the proceeds from any sale of shares of our common stock by
the selling stockholders.

    We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay $5 million of
seller financed notes and the remainder to pay all outstanding balances under
our revolving credit facility and for general corporate purposes, which may
include cash payments made in connection with future acquisitions. Our amended
and restated senior credit facility consists of a $170 million U.S. revolver, a
$30 million Canadian revolver and a term loan facility of $419 million. As of
February 28, 2006, we had $419 million of indebtedness outstanding under the
term loan portion of our senior credit facility. The current term loan bears
interest at either a base rate plus 1.75%, or the London Interbank Offered Rate
(“LIBOR”) plus 2.50%, and matures in September 2012. As of February 28, 2006, we
had approximately $124.4 million in indebtedness outstanding under our revolving
credit facility. The revolving credit facility bears interest at either a base
rate plus an applicable margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.75%, or LIBOR plus an
applicable margin between 1.25% and 2.75% in the case of U.S. borrowings. In the
case of borrowings under the Canadian revolving credit facility, interest is
based on the Canadian Base Rate (as defined in the Credit Agreement) plus an
applicable margin ranging between 0.25% and 1.75%. Our borrowings under the term
loan and revolving credit facility were used to refinance existing debt, to pay
the Dividend as described below and to provide for ongoing working capital and
general corporate purposes.
  
    An affiliate of Credit Suisse Securities (USA) LLC and an affiliate of UBS
Securities LLC have each committed $11.8 million (or approximately 7%) of our
$170 million U.S. revolver and therefore will receive a portion of the proceeds
from this offering that we use to repay our U.S. revolver. Credit Suisse
Securities (USA) LLC and UBS Securities LLC are underwriters of this offering."

is for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Prakash with compensation
in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in
the northern Virginia area, that the fee charged by Everest Telecom LLC is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person.

We intend to use approximately $150,000 of the working capital allocation for
director and officer liability insurance premiums and hold the balance of
$355,000, or $598,060 if the representative’s over-allotment option is exercised
in full, in reserve in case due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our
officers, directors and/or our senior advisors in connection with activities on
our behalf as described below. In addition, although we have no present
intention to do so, we could in the future find it necessary or desirable to use
a portion of these funds to make a down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from
“shopping” around for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable
to such target businesses) with respect to a particular business combination. If
so, any such amount would be based on the terms of the specific business
combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. If we use a
portion of our funds for such a purpose and the related business combination
does not occur and we are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of
our breach of the agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we
could, if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the funds
allocated to due diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted
transaction, be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or
conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund that are not used for such purpose, as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business.

Our initial securityholders advanced us a total of $52,500 which was used to pay
a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the table above for the
SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The
loans are due and payable without interest on the earlier of September 15, 2006
or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not held in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or cash
equivalents or be invested only in United States “government securities,”
defined as any Treasury Bill issued by within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived
from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time. 

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Everest Telecom LLC the fee
described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our initial securityholders, including our officers, directors or
senior advisors, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination.
However, they will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A Class B stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event there is no business combination or if that Class B stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the Class B stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a Class B stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund. Under no circumstances will
holders of common stock have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust fund."

     (1) Of this amount, the underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting fees
         in an amount equal to 3% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or
         $0.24 per unit ($1,050,000 in total, or $1,207,500 if the
         over-allotment option is exercised), until the consummation of a
         business combination. Upon the consummation of a business combination, 
         we will pay such fees out of the proceeds of this offering held in 
         trust. However, we will not be obligated to pay such portion of 
         the 3% deferred underwriting fee out of the proceeds of this offering 
         that will be paid from the trust account to the stockholders that 
         vote against a business combination and elect to exercise its, his 
         or her redemption rights.
 
     (2) Any down payment or lock-up payment would be limited to the amount
         allocated to excess working capital. Any use of funds on a down payment
         or lock-up payment could increase the chance that management or
         existing stockholders would incur additional out-of-pocket expenses.
 
     $32,378,000, or $37,418,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination. Excess working capital will be sufficient to cover miscellaneous
expenses based upon our extensive experience of doing business in Asia. This
experience includes management team member's affiliation with General Motors
from 1993 to 2001. During that period, General Motors embarked upon a program to
establish component operations in China, India and the ASEAN Region. Management
was responsible for researching, locating and negotiating joint ventures and
wholly owned subsidiaries to establish those operations. As a result of that
activity, management gained an insight into the size, scope and capabilities of
supplier companies in the region. All those companies researched were of
comparable size to 80% of our future net assets.
 
     The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting fees in an amount equal
to 3% of the gross proceeds of this offering, or $0.24 per unit ($1,050,000 in
total, or $1,207,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised), until the
consummation of a business combination. Upon the consummation of a business
combination, we will pay such fees out of the proceeds of this offering held in
trust. However, we will not be obligated to pay such portion of the 3% deferred
underwriting fee out of the proceeds of this offering that will be paid from the
trust account to the stockholders that vote against a business combination and
elect to exercise its, his or her redemption rights.
 
     The payment to Asia Development Capital LLC, an affiliate of William R.
Herren, the chairman of our board of directors, Rudy Wilson, our chief executive
officer and a member of our board of directors, Vinit Bansal, our president of
India operations and a member of our board of directors and Chun Yi Hao, our
president of China operations and a member of our board of directors, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services, office space,
and utilities in our offices located in Birmingham, Michigan, Beijing, China,
Hong Kong, Bangkok and Delhi, India. This arrangement is being agreed to by Asia
Development Capital LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs.
Herren, Wilson, Bansal and Hao compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in these locations, that the fee
charged by Asia Development Capital LLC is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.
 
     Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $780,000. We intend to use the excess
working capital (approximately $134,000) for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $70,000) $180,000 for payment of
administrative fee to Asia Development Capital LLC, $10,000 for SEC Reporting,
with the balance of $466,000 being held for due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations, as well as
for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors and may include engaging market
research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors will
not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due diligence activities. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.   
 
     It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working
capital to pay finder's fees, consulting fees or other similar compensation,
make a deposit, a down payment, a lock-up payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision
with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not
have any current intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as
a down payment or lock-up payment would be determined based on the terms of the
specific business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time.
In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds (whether as
a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise),
we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available outside of the
trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses related to finding
another suitable business combination without securing additional financing.
Thus, if we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely
fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and would be
forced to liquidate.
 
     To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.
 
     Each of William Herren, Rudy Wilson, Vinit Bansal, Chun Hao and Asia
Development Capital LLC have advanced to us $5,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loans will be payable on the earlier of March 31, 2006 or the consummation of
this offering and will bear interest at the rate of 4.0% per annum. The loans
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.
 
     The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bills issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from investment of these
net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.
 
     We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.
 
     Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the
consummation of the acquisition of the target business we will pay Asia
Development Capital LLC the fee described above. A public stockholder will be
entitled to receive funds from the trust account (including interest earned on
his, her or its portion of the trust account) only in the event of our
liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to redeem such shares for
cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."
"CATALYST BIOSCIENCES, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/catalyst-biosciences-inc-187177-48175,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/catalyst-biosciences-inc-187177-48175,424B4,4/12/2006,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4340589,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of 5,000,000 shares of our
common stock in this offering will be approximately $40.7 million, or
approximately $47.0 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based on the initial public offering price of $9.00 per share
and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use these net proceeds as follows:

    •   approximately $10 million to complete our ongoing Phase I clinical trial,  
        to conduct Phase II clinical trials and to conduct formulation activities  
        for TC-2696, our product candidate for acute post-operative pain;          

    •   approximately $9 million to conduct the additional preclinical safety      
        studies necessary to support an IND for clinical trials, to conduct Phase I
        and Phase II clinical trials of TC-2216, our product candidate for         
        depression and anxiety disorders;                                          

    •   approximately $6 million to conduct the additional preclinical safety      
        studies necessary to support an IND for clinical trials and, unless        
        licensed by us to AstraZeneca under the terms of our collaboration         
        agreement, to conduct Phase I clinical trials of TC-5619;                  

    •   approximately $4 million to fund preclinical testing and other research and
        development activities in one or more of the areas of smoking cessation,   
        obesity and inflammation;                                                  

    •   approximately $2 million to complete our ongoing Phase II clinical trial of
        mecamylamine hydrochloride as an add-on therapy for depression; and        

    •   the remaining $9.7 million to fund general and administrative expenses,    
        other research and development expenses, working capital needs and other   
        general corporate purposes.                                                

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds for the potential acquisition of,
or investment in, technologies, products or companies that complement our
business, although we have no current understandings, commitments or agreements
to do so.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress and status of our
development and commercialization efforts, the amount of proceeds actually
raised in this offering, the amount of cash generated through our existing
strategic collaboration with AstraZeneca, any additional strategic
collaborations into which we may enter and sales of Inversine, and our operating
costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. We may
change the allocation of use of these proceeds as a result of contingencies such
as the progress and results of our clinical trials and other research and
development activities, product development timelines and the status of our
intellectual property position, a decision by us to conduct a Phase III clinical
trial of mecamylamine hydrochloride or to accelerate the development of TC-5214
as an add-on therapy for depression in lieu of further advancement of
mecamylamine hydrochloride, any decision by us to offer TC-5619 or any other
compound to AstraZeneca and by AstraZeneca to license the compound under the
terms of our collaboration agreement, the establishment of collaborations, the
results of our commercialization efforts, our manufacturing requirements and
regulatory or competitive developments. In particular, if AstraZeneca terminates
our collaboration agreement following the completion of the additional safety
and product characterization studies of TC-1734 that

AstraZeneca is conducting and we choose to fund the clinical development of
TC-1734 on our own, we would need to use a substantial portion of the net
proceeds of this offering for that purpose or seek additional funds from
external sources. 

Under our collaboration agreement, AstraZeneca will assume substantially all
development costs for TC-1734. As a result, we do not expect to use any of the
net proceeds of this offering in the development of TC-1734. We do not expect
our existing capital resources and the net proceeds from this offering to be
sufficient to enable us to fund the completion of the development of any of our
other product candidates. We expect that the net proceeds from this offering
will be sufficient to enable us to: complete our ongoing Phase II clinical trial
of mecamylamine hydrochloride; conduct the additional preclinical safety studies
necessary to support an IND for clinical trials, conduct Phase I and Phase II
clinical trials of TC-2216; complete our ongoing Phase I clinical trial and
conduct Phase II clinical trials of TC-2696; and conduct the additional
preclinical safety studies necessary to support an IND for clinical trials and
conduct Phase I clinical trials of TC-5619. It is possible that we will not make
the progress that we expect because the actual costs and timing of drug
development, particularly clinical trials, are highly uncertain, are subject to
substantial risk and often change depending on the target indication, the
particular development strategy and the results of earlier clinical trials. It
is also possible that we will not make the progress that we expect because we
change the allocation of use of the net proceeds of this offering as a result of
contingencies, including any termination of our collaboration agreement by
AstraZeneca or any of the other contingencies described in the preceding
paragraph. As a result, we may need to raise additional funds from external
sources to make the development progress described in this paragraph.

Until the funds are used as described above, we intend to invest the net
proceeds from this offering in short-term interest-bearing, investment grade
securities."

from the sale of our common stock in this offering, based on the initial public
offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. Our net
proceeds will increase by approximately $8.0 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for the continued
clinical trials of our product candidates, other research and development
activities, and for working capital purposes. More specifically, we currently
intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

•  Approximately $25.0 million to complete our ongoing Phase III trial for        
   iloperidone in schizophrenia, which we currently anticipate will be completed  
   in the first half of 2007                                                      
  
•  Approximately $10.0 million to complete our current Phase III trial for VEC-162
   in insomnia                                                                    
  
•  Approximately $5.0 million to complete a Phase II trial for VSF-173 in         
   excessive sleepiness                                                           
  
•  Approximately $5.0 million to pursue our other ongoing research and development
   activities, which may include the further development of our extended-release  
   injectable formulation of iloperidone in schizophrenia.                        

We anticipate that the balance of such net proceeds will be used for general
corporate purposes as determined by our management, including for working
capital, milestone payments under our existing license agreements, to the extent
they become due, and the acquisition or licensing of businesses or product
candidates that are complementary to our own. However, due to the uncertainties
inherent in the clinical trial process and given that our product candidates
have not completed their clinical development, we are unable to estimate
precisely the total costs that will be associated with completing the
above-mentioned clinical trials, and accordingly we cannot estimate precisely
what proceeds will be available for general corporate purposes. The actual
amounts could vary materially from our estimates. Currently, we have no specific
plans or commitments with respect to any acquisition or license. We cannot
assure you that we will complete any acquisitions or licenses or that, if
completed, any acquisition or license will be successful.

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress of our research and development activities and
clinical trials, the number and breadth of our product development programs, our
ability to establish and maintain corporate collaborations and other
arrangements and the amount of cash, if any, generated by our operations.
We will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the remaining net
proceeds of this offering. Pending application of the net proceeds, as described
above, we intend to invest any remaining proceeds in short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

sale of 12,000,000 shares of Class A common stock offered by this prospectus,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses
payable by us. We base this amount on the initial public offering price of
$17.00 per share of Class A common stock.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from the Global Offering to:

        º pay $154.5 million of the $294.5 million purchase price of the two Ice
          Class 1A Handymax product tankers and three Panamax product tankers;
          and

        º repay the $28.0 million of debt that we owe under the Sellers' Notes
          plus any accrued interest thereon in connection with the purchase of
          our Initial Fleet.

    We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds from the Global Offering
if any for working capital and general corporate purposes.

    Contemporaneously with the closing of the Global Offering we intend to
borrow $178.5 million under our new senior secured credit facility to:

        º repay the indebtedness of $38.5 million under our existing senior
          secured credit facility; and

        º pay the balance of the purchase price of the two Ice Class 1A Handymax
          product tankers and three Panamax product tankers.


    We intend to finance the acquisition of the remaining Panamax product tanker
with borrowings under the revolving credit line portion of the new senior
secured credit facility.

    The Sellers' Notes mature on April 13, 2006 and bear interest at 4.0% per
annum. The term loan portion of our new senior secured credit facility will
accrue interest at a floating rate based on LIBOR, for which we have entered
into a three year swap/collar agreement, and will be due in installments over a
five-year period commencing six months after we enter into the facility.

    If the over-allotment option or a portion thereof is exercised by the U.S.
or Singapore underwriters, we will use the net proceeds to fund the vessels
acquisitions, repay indebtedness or for general corporate purposes. Also, if we
do not purchase any or all of the two Ice Class 1A Handymax product tankers and
three Panamax product tankers, we may use the net proceeds of the Global
Offering, less the $28.0 million that we owe under the Sellers' Notes, to
purchase other vessels. In particular, certain events may arise which could
result in us not taking delivery of a vessel, such as a total loss of a vessel,
a constructive total loss of a vessel, or substantial damage to a vessel prior
to its delivery."

public offering price of $16.00 per share set forth on the cover page of this
prospectus.

    In addition, 8,000,000 shares are being offered by the selling stockholders.
We will receive no proceeds from the sale of the shares of our common stock by
the selling stockholders, including any net proceeds from the sale of up to

    Of approximately $294.2 million of net proceeds we expect to receive from
this offering, we intend to use approximately $86.7 million to redeem the
outstanding principal amount of our PIK notes and pay accrued interest thereon
and a related redemption premium, approximately $54.3 million to redeem a
portion of the outstanding principal amount of the 2014 notes and pay accrued
interest and a related redemption premium, $125.0 million to pay a special
dividend to our existing stockholders, approximately $17.2 million to pay a
transaction-related bonus to members of management and $11.0 million to KKR in
order to terminate our future obligations under our management services
agreement.

    Our board of directors, which will declare the special dividend and
management's bonus, includes representatives of our existing stockholders and
members of management who will receive the dividend and bonus. Investors in this
offering will not receive any portion of the special dividend. The PIK notes

deploying additional sales representatives and sales support personnel, pursuing
international sales and expanding our marketing and advertising campaigns,
including trade shows, to generate greater brand awareness. We expect that
enhancements to our product offerings and additional research and development
initiatives will include the continued evolution of our current suite of

model to monitor lower acuity beds, emergency departments and other special care
units and modifying our solution for sale to international markets.

discretion in applying the net proceeds from this offering.

     from the sale of common stock to our existing stockholders and, if          
     necessary, from our limited recourse revolving line of credit of up to      
     $1,750,000 extended by Ronald F. Valenta, a director and our Chief Executive
     Officer. As of February 28, 2006, we had paid $79,625 in offering expenses  
     from the $250,000 proceeds from the sale of common stock to our existing    
     stockholders. We will retain from the proceeds of this offering, and not    
     deposit into the trust account, an amount equal to our offering expenses. If
     we have utilized our limited recourse revolving line of credit to pay some  
     of the offering expenses, we will repay the limited recourse revolving line 
     of credit, including interest at the rate of 8% per annum, with these       
     proceeds.

    We will place $57,150,000 ($65,700,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase NY Bank,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or the expiration of the time period during which we may
complete a business combination. The proceeds held in the trust account (other
than the contingent underwriting discount) may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination.
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account (other than the contingent underwriting discount) will be used to
finance the operations of the target business. We may also
use the proceeds held in the trust account (other than the contingent
underwriting discount) to pay a finder’s fee to any unaffiliated party that
provides information regarding prospective targets to us. Any such fee would be
conditioned on our consummating a business combination with the identified
target. We anticipate that such fee, if any, would be a percentage of the
consideration associated with such business combination, with the percentage to
be determined based on local market conditions at the time of such combination.

    None of the proceeds of this offering will be used to fund our operations
prior to a business combination. We believe that, upon consummation of this
offering, the remaining proceeds from the sale of common stock to our existing
stockholders prior to this offering and from the limited recourse line of credit
provided by Ronald F. Valenta will be sufficient to fund our operations for at
least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time. However, the report by LaRue, Corrigan & McCormick
LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, contains a going concern
qualification.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest net of taxes) only in the event of the liquidation
of the trust account or if such stockholder converts such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against
and which we consummate. Under no other circumstances will a public stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our existing
stockholders have waived any conversion rights with respect to shares of common
stock held by them prior to this offering or shares they may acquire in or after
this offering."

(1)  We have paid, and will pay, offering expenses referenced in the line items  
     above prior to the close of this offering utilizing the $250,000 we received
     from the sale of common stock to our existing stockholders and, if          
     necessary, from our limited recourse revolving line of credit of up to      
     $1,750,000 extended by Ronald F. Valenta, a director and our Chief Executive
     Officer. As of February 28, 2006, we had paid $79,625 in offering expenses  
     from the $250,000 proceeds from the sale of common stock to our existing    
     stockholders. We will retain from the proceeds of this offering, and not    
     deposit into the trust account, an amount equal to our offering expenses. If
     we have utilized our limited recourse revolving line of credit to pay some  
     of the offering expenses, we will repay the limited recourse revolving line 
     of credit, including interest at the rate of 8% per annum, with these       
     proceeds.                                                                   
(2)  Includes the contingent underwriting discount.                              

    We will place $57,150,000 ($65,700,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) in a trust account at JP Morgan Chase NY Bank,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the
Investment Company Act of 1940, having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or the expiration of the time period during which we may
complete a business combination. The proceeds held in the trust account (other
than the contingent underwriting discount) may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination.
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account (other than the contingent underwriting discount) will be used to
finance the operations of the target business. We may also
use the proceeds held in the trust account (other than the contingent
underwriting discount) to pay a finder’s fee to any unaffiliated party that
provides information regarding prospective targets to us. Any such fee would be
conditioned on our consummating a business combination with the identified
target. We anticipate that such fee, if any, would be a percentage of the
consideration associated with such business combination, with the percentage to
be determined based on local market conditions at the time of such combination.

    None of the proceeds of this offering will be used to fund our operations
prior to a business combination. We believe that, upon consummation of this
offering, the remaining proceeds from the sale of common stock to our existing
stockholders prior to this offering and from the limited recourse line of credit
provided by Ronald F. Valenta will be sufficient to fund our operations for at
least the next 24 months, assuming that a business combination is not
consummated during that time. However, the report by LaRue, Corrigan & McCormick

connection with a business combination that the public stockholder voted against
and which we consummate. Under no other circumstances will a public stockholder
have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account. Our existing
stockholders have waived any conversion rights with respect to shares of common
stock held by them prior to this offering or shares they may acquire in or after

We may use the portion of the net proceeds that we do not contribute to Lake
Shore Savings to, among other things, invest in securities, pay cash dividends
or repurchase shares of common stock, subject to regulatory restrictions or for
other general corporate purposes. Lake Shore Savings may use the portion of the
proceeds that it receives to fund new loans, open or acquire new branches,
invest in securities, expand its business activities or for other general
corporate purposes. We may also use the proceeds of the offering to diversify
our business and acquire other companies, although we have no such specific
plans this time.

Due to the difficult economic environment in our market area, it may take a
significant amount of time for us to deploy the offering proceeds to our best
advantage. For example, due to intense competition and market rates, our
borrower demand may be limited. We plan to initially apply the net proceeds we
receive from the offering to qualified investments in accordance with our
investment policy. It is expected that the investments will include asset-backed
securities, collateralized mortgage obligations, and mortgage-back securities
with terms that will range from one to four years in average lives and
maturities up to ten years."

stock, after deducting approximately $26.0 million of estimated underwriting
discounts and offering expenses, will be approximately $374.0 million. We intend
to: (1) use approximately $60.2 million to redeem a portion of our 143/4% senior
discount notes due 2014; (2) contribute approximately $123.1 million to our
subsidiary, Mueller Group, LLC (""Mueller Group""), which will use such proceeds
to redeem a portion of its 10% senior subordinated notes due 2012 and pay
accrued interest; and (3) contribute approximately $190.7 million to Mueller
Group, which will use such proceeds to optionally prepay a portion of the term
loan outstanding under the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement. We will use any
remaining proceeds for general corporate and other purposes.

    Affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co.
Incorporated and Calyon Securities (USA) Inc., three of the underwriters in this
offering, are lenders under the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement. It is anticipated
that affiliates of Banc of America Securities LLC and Calyon Securities (USA)
Inc. will receive approximately $2.9 million and $1.8 million, respectively, of
the proceeds from this offering through the partial repayment of the term loan
outstanding under the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement, based on the aggregate
principal amount of the term loan outstanding as of the date of this prospectus.

(assuming a May 31, 2006 completion of this offering unless otherwise specified)

(1)  º Represents redemption of approximately $52.5 million in accreted value of
     our 143/4% senior discount notes due 2014 and a payment of approximately
     $7.7 million of a contractual premium based on the amount required at the
     assumed redemption date. In addition, as a result of the early repayment,
     the Company will record a favorable adjustment to interest expense of
     approximately $8.5 million for adjustment for the difference between the
     carrying value and the contractual obligation.

(2)  º Represents redemption of approximately $110.3 million of Mueller Group's
     10% senior subordinated notes due 2012 and a payment of approximately
     $12.8 million of a contractual premium and accrued interest based on the
     amount required at the assumed redemption date. In addition, as a result of
     the early repayment, the Company will record a favorable adjustment to
     interest expense of approximately $5.8 million for adjustment for the
     difference between the carrying value and the contractual obligation.

(3)  º Represents the optional prepayment of a portion of the $1,050.0 million
     term loan outstanding under the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement. There is no
     prepayment premium or penalty associated with the term loan. The senior
     credit facilities under the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement consist of:
     (1) an amortizing senior secured term loan facility in an initial aggregate
     principal amount of $1,050.0 million ($1,044.8 million of which is
     currently outstanding) and (2) a $145.0 million senior
     secured revolving credit facility, which provides for loans and under which
     letters of credit may be issued. The revolving credit facility will
     terminate on October 4, 2010, and the term loans will mature on November 1,
     2011 (or October 3, 2012, if the 10% senior subordinated notes due 2012 are
     paid in full or refinanced prior to such date). Loans under the senior
     credit facilities currently bear interest, at our option, at:
     (x) initially, the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 250 basis points or the
     alternate base rate plus 150 basis points for borrowings under the
     revolving credit facility; and (y) the reserve adjusted LIBOR rate plus 225
     basis points or the alternate base rate plus 125 basis points for term
     loans. The proceeds of the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement were used to
     retire certain old debt of Predecessor Mueller and to finance the
     Acquisition.

(4)  º Represents estimated underwriting discounts and fees and legal, accounting
     and other fees and expenses.

    We intend to contribute the net proceeds from any shares of our Series A
common stock sold pursuant to the underwriters' option to purchase additional
shares to Mueller Group, which intends to use such proceeds to optionally prepay
an additional portion of the term loan outstanding under the 2005 Mueller Credit
Agreement or for general corporate purposes.

    Any decrease in the aggregate amount of net proceeds raised in this offering
(assuming net proceeds of at least $183.3 million are raised) will decrease the
amount of debt under the 2005 Mueller Credit Agreement to be prepaid, but will
not affect the amount of senior discount notes or senior subordinated notes to
be redeemed. Any increase in the aggregate amount of net proceeds raised in this
offering will be used to optionally prepay additional debt under the 2005
Mueller Credit Agreement or for general corporate purposes."

stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses,
will be approximately $2.28 billion (or $2.45 billion if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). We intend to use
all but $650 million of our net proceeds from this offering (including any
proceeds received pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
shares) to redeem a number of shares of Class B common stock from our existing
stockholders that is equal to the aggregate number of shares of Class A common
stock that we issue to investors in this offering (including any shares sold
pursuant to the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares) and to The
MasterCard Foundation. We intend to use the remaining proceeds to increase our
capital, defend ourselves against legal and regulatory challenges, expand our
role in targeted geographies and higher growth segments of the global payments
industry and for other general corporate purposes. However, we have not
determined the amounts of such remaining proceeds that are to be allocated to
these purposes. We will determine these amounts in our sole discretion and may

B common stock described above. In addition, several of the underwriters or
their affiliates also perform other services for us."

stock in this offering will be approximately $493.7 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

    The primary purposes of the offering are to fund the expansion of our
business, including funding marketing expenses and operating losses, and to
create a public market for our common stock. In addition, we could use a portion
of the proceeds of this offering to pursue acquisitions or to make strategic
investments. Our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the
net proceeds of this offering. The amounts actually expended and the timing of
such expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including our realization
of the different elements of our growth strategy and the amount of cash
generated by our operations. Pending their use to fund our expansion, the
proceeds of the offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing
securities.

    We have requested that, pursuant to our Directed Share Programs, the
underwriters reserve up to 13.5% and 1.5% of the common stock offered in this
prospectus for sale to certain of our customers and other persons related to us,
respectively, at the initial public offering price. See ""Underwriting—Directed
Share Programs"" for more information. In connection with the Directed Share
Programs, we have agreed to indemnify the underwriters against certain
liabilities, including those that may be caused by the failure of Directed Share
Program participants to pay for and accept delivery of the common stock which
had been allocated to them or were subject to a properly confirmed agreement to
purchase. As a result, our expected net proceeds could be reduced if Directed
Share Program participants fail to pay for and accept delivery of the common
stock which had been allocated to them or were subject to a properly confirmed
agreement to purchase and, as a result, we must indemnify the underwriters for
such failure."

$74.9 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses of $8.6 million. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, we estimate our net proceeds will be
approximately $86.5 million.

    A portion of the net proceeds of this offering will be used to redeem all of
the shares of our Series A Preferred Stock and all of the shares of our Series C
Preferred Stock owned by Alleghany at an aggregate redemption price of
$2.3 million and $2.5 million, respectively. As of the date of this prospectus,
Alleghany owns shares of our Series A Preferred Stock having an aggregate
liquidation preference of $2.3 million, shares of our Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock having an aggregate liquidation preference of $197.2 million and
shares of our Series C Preferred Stock having an aggregate liquidation
preference of $2.5 million. Shares of Series C Preferred Stock are paid as
dividends on outstanding shares of our Series B Convertible Preferred Stock on a
quarterly basis at the rate of 5.0% per annum (increasing to 6.0% for calendar
year 2007), and the next dividend on the shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock will be due on July 1, 2006.

    The remaining $70.1 million of the estimated net proceeds of this offering
will be used to redeem a portion of the shares of our Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock at a redemption price per share, on an as-converted basis, equal
to the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. Upon
completion of this offering, the remaining outstanding shares of our Series B
Convertible Preferred Stock will automatically convert into 10,138,881 shares of
our common stock. The net proceeds of this offering will not be used for any
purpose other than to reduce Alleghany’s ownership interest in us.

    After application of the use of the net proceeds of this offering and the
automatic conversion of our remaining outstanding shares of Series B Convertible
Preferred Stock as described above, no shares of preferred stock will be
outstanding, and we estimate that Alleghany will own shares of our common stock
representing approximately 59.6% of our issued and outstanding shares of common
stock (excluding shares of common stock underlying options to purchase
approximately 1.0% of our shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted
basis that we intend to grant to key employees at the time this offering is
completed).

$393 million after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses. We expect to use a significant amount of the net
proceeds to repay $350 million in outstanding amounts under the term loan A and
the term loan B-1 of our senior secured credit facility that were incurred to
finance, in large part, the February 2006 dividend of $367 million, which was
paid principally to the private equity funds controlled by the sponsors and
members of senior management with the balance used for general corporate
purposes. As a result, a significant amount of the proceeds of this offering
will not be invested in our business. The interest rate under the senior secured
credit facility for term loan A and the revolving credit facility is at our
option either (a) the greater of the federal funds effective rate plus 0.50% and
the prime rate, which we refer to as ABR, plus a rate not to exceed 0.75%, which
varies according to our leverage ratio or (b) LIBOR plus a rate not to exceed
1.75%, which varies according to our leverage ratio. The interest rate for term
loan B-1 is at our option either (a) ABR, plus a rate of 0.50% or (b) LIBOR plus
1.50%, in each case so long as our leverage ratio remains at or below certain
levels (but in any event not to exceed 0.75%, in the case of ABR loans, and
1.75% in the case of LIBOR loans). The interest rate for term loan A and term
loan B-1 was 6.75% and 6.50%, respectively, as of March 31, 2006. The term
loan A matures in June 2011 and the term loan B-1 matures in June 2012.

    We will not receive any of the net proceeds from any sale of common stock by
the selling stockholders pursuant to the option granted by the selling
stockholders to the underwriters."

support the expansion of our correspondent base, which is in part dependent on
the amount of our regulatory capital. Our ability to accept additional
correspondents and increase our margin lending revenues is constrained by the
amount of regulatory capital we have. Initially, we intend to use all of the net
proceeds to repay indebtedness and to make our planned capital contribution in
connection with a corporate reorganization as described in “Management’s
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations—Split
off transaction.” The increased borrowing availability under our credit
facilities resulting from this use of proceeds will be used to fund our daily
working capital needs and for general corporate purposes. As opportunities
become available to expand our client base, we will also be able to utilize our
available lines of credit at higher levels by virtue of the expanded capital
base resulting from the proceeds of this offering. We may also use this
increased borrowing availability for acquisitions of businesses, products or
technologies that are complementary to our business. We will not receive any 
of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

-----
The net proceeds from the sale of the 6,258,000 shares of common stock offered
by us will be approximately $96.1 million, based on an initial public offering
price of $17.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters
exercise the over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds
will be $110.9 million, after deducting the estimated discounts, commissions and
expenses. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the
selling stockholders.

The proceeds of this offering will expand our regulatory capital base, which
will allow us to utilize a greater portion of our available lines of credit to
support expansion of our client base. Our ability to accept additional
correspondents and increase our margin lending revenues is constrained by the
amount of regulatory capital we have. By repaying a portion of our existing
indebtedness, we will be able to access our increased borrowing availability for
working capital needs and other corporate purposes. Initially, we intend to use
all of the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

•  in the event the split off transaction is completed, to fund a transfer of cash
   to SAMCO Holdings in connection with the split off in the amount of            
   approximately $7.2 million in connection with a corporate reorganization as    
   described in “Management’s discussion and analysis of financial condition and  
   results of operations—Discontinued operations”;                                
  
•  to repay approximately $30 million of long-term indebtedness under a bank term 
   loan due in March 2010 with an interest rate of 7.25% as of March 31, 2006.    
   These borrowings were used to support our regulatory capital and working       
   capital needs;                                                                 
  
•  to repay a short-term promissory note of $15 million due June 2006 with a      
   variable rate of interest that approximated 6.3% as of March 31, 2006, which   
   was incurred to support our regulatory capital and working capital needs; and  
  
•  to repay, with the balance of the net proceeds, a portion of our borrowings    
   under our secured short-term bank loans outstanding under our uncommitted lines
   of credit with four financial institutions and/ or under our stock loans. The  
   short-term bank loans bear interest at a rate that varies from day to day and  
   is linked to the prevailing Federal Funds rate, do not have a maturity date and
   can be withdrawn by the lenders thereunder at any time. These borrowings were  
   used to support the daily working capital needs of our subsidiaries.           

The increased borrowing availability under our credit facilities resulting from
this use of proceeds will be available to support our working capital needs and
for other general corporate purposes. We may also use a portion of our borrowing
availability for acquisitions of businesses, products and technologies or the
establishment of joint ventures that are complementary to our business. We are
currently in active discussions with various parties, but at this time no
potential transaction is probable."

    We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital and
general corporate purposes, including expanding our domestic and international
marketing and sales organizations and programs, increasing our new product
development efforts and increasing our clinical study initiatives. We have not
yet determined with certainty the manner in which we will allocate these net

a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations,
competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of
our business.

underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the
net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $36.5 million.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. The amounts and timing
of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from our expectations
depending upon numerous factors, including the progress of our clinical trials,
and our operating costs and capital expenditures. Accordingly, we will retain
the discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering among the
identified uses described below, and we reserve the right to change the
allocation of the net proceeds among the uses described below as a result of
contingencies such as the progress and results of our clinical trials and our
development activities, the results of our commercialization efforts and
competitive developments.

follows:
                                             
•                 approximately $20 million to fund our research and development

•                 approximately $3 million to commercialize our lead product, GEM

•                 approximately $1 million to license additional molecules and

We also may use a portion of the net proceeds for the potential acquisition of,

from our sale of the shares of common stock in this offering, based upon the
initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $75.5 million.

The principal purposes of this offering are to make capital expenditures to
enhance our operations, to repay a significant portion of our outstanding
indebtedness, to establish a public market for our common stock, to facilitate
our future access to public markets and to provide liquidity for existing
stockholders. We intend to use between $12.0 million and $15.0 million of the
net proceeds of this offering to make capital expenditures primarily for the
manufacture and placement of our systems under contracts to our customers. We
intend to use approximately $5.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering to
repay outstanding indebtedness under our XACP notes, as required by the terms of
those notes. The XACP notes bear interest at an annual rate of 7.0% and mature
on the earlier of the completion of this offering and October 14, 2008. We
issued the XACP notes in order to fund general working capital purposes.

In addition, we intend to use approximately $4.2 million of the net proceeds of
this offering to repay our outstanding indebtedness under our senior secured
loan with BWCA I, LLC, which we refer to as the BWCA loan, including a
prepayment penalty of $0.2 million. The indebtedness under the BWCA loan bears
interest at an annual rate of 9.0%, must be repaid in seven annual installments
beginning December 31, 2006 and matures on December 31, 2013. We must pay a
prepayment penalty of 5.0% in connection with the early prepayment of this loan.

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds of the offering for general
corporate purposes. This may include expansion of our sales and marketing
efforts as well as expansion of our manufacturing capabilities to meet
anticipated demand for our systems.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly from
our expectations depending upon numerous factors, including our results of
operation, financial condition and capital requirements. Accordingly, we will
retain the discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this offering among the
identified uses described above, and we reserve the right to change the
allocation of the net proceeds among the uses described above. Pending their
use, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing,

(1)               Approximately $80,000 of the offering expenses, including the  
                  SEC registration fee, the NASD filing fee and a portion of the 
                  non-accountable expense allowance and legal and audit fees,    
                  have been paid from the funds we received from Don K. Rice     
                  described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds
                  of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of
                  this offering.                                                 
                                           
(2)               For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discount is     
                  reflected as the amount payable to the underwriter upon        
                  consummation of this offering. An additional $828,000, or      
                  $952,200 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, all
                  of which will be deposited in trust following the consummation 
                  of this offering, is payable to the underwriter only if and    
                  when we consummate a business combination.   

In addition to the offering of units by this prospectus, Don K. Rice, our
chairman of the board, chief executive officer, president and treasurer, has
committed to purchase the insider units (for an aggregate purchase price of
$1,000,002) from us. This purchase will take place on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. We will not pay any
discounts or commissions with respect to the purchase of the insider units. All
of the proceeds we receive from this purchase will be placed in the trust fund
described below.

$32,488,000, or $37,510,200 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering, plus the $1,000,002 we will receive from the
sale of the insider units, will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. This amount includes a portion of the underwriting discounts payable to
the underwriter in the offering. The underwriter has agreed that such amount
will not be paid unless and until we consummate a business combination and has
waived its right to receive such payment upon our liquidation if we are unable
to complete a business combination. The funds held in trust will be invested
only in United States ‘‘government securities’’ within the meaning of Section
2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or
less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we complete a business combination.

The payment to 400 Building LLC, an affiliate of Arthur Spector, our special
advisor, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services
including office space, utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is
being agreed to by 400 Building LLC for our benefit and is not intended to
provide Mr. Spector compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, that the
fee charged by 400 Building LLC is at least as favorable as we could have
obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon
completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust account to
our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable
target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and from the
offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine
their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the
funds not held in trust and currently allocated to ‘‘Legal, accounting and other
expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring and
negotiation of a business combination,’’ ‘‘Due diligence of prospective target
businesses’’ and ‘‘Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O
insurance, taxes and reserves.’’ Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $145,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $80,000), with
the balance of $65,000 being held in reserve for tax payments and in the event
due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described above. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of the funds
not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds not being
placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from
‘‘shopping’’ around for transactions with other companies on terms more
favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do
so. If we entered into a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive
exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a down
payment or to fund a ‘‘no-shop’’ provision would be determined based on the
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States ‘‘government
securities’’ so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business.

Don K. Rice has advanced to us a total of $80,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of December 20, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

offering will be approximately $188.3 million (or approximately $216.6 million
if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full), based on the
initial public offering price of $15.00 per share and after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions (including the financial advisory fee
payable to Ferris, Baker Watts, Incorporated) of approximately $14.2 million (or
approximately $16.3 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is
exercised in full), but without giving effect to the payment of public offering
costs of approximately $6.0 million. In addition, CGI and Pharos have each
agreed to purchase in separate private placement transactions to close in
conjunction with the closing of this offering a number of shares in the trust
having an aggregate purchase price of approximately $86 million and $4 million,
respectively, at a per share price equal to the initial public offering price.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, from the separate
private placement transactions and from the initial borrowing under our third
party credit facility to:
   •  pay the purchase price and related costs of the acquisition of our initial  
      business of approximately $140.8 million;                                   
  
   •  make loans to each of our initial businesses to repay outstanding debt and  
      to provide capitalization in an aggregate principal amount of               
      $170.8 million;                                                             
  
   •  pay the public offering costs of approximately $6.0 million; and            
  
   •  provide funds for general corporate purposes of approximately of            
      $4.6 million.

of the 12,500,000 common units we are offering, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The
underwriters will not receive any discount or commission on the 500,000 common
units offered to Joseph W. Craft III, the President, Chief Executive Officer and
Chairman of the board of directors of our general partner, or an entity
controlled by him. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units in full, we expect to receive net proceeds of
approximately $333.1 million.

The net proceeds from this offering will be paid to the management investors as
consideration for the contribution to us of their partnership interests in ARLP,
as more fully described under “Prospectus Summary—Alliance Holdings GP,
L.P.—Pre-offering Structure.” If the underwriters exercise all or any portion of
their option to purchase additional common units, we will use all of the net
proceeds from the sale of our common units sold pursuant to the exercise of that
option to fund the redemption of an equal number of common units from the
management investors and Mr. Craft. The redemption price per common unit will be
equal to the price per common unit (net of underwriting discounts) sold to the
underwriters upon exercise of their option to purchase additional common units."

stock offered by us will be approximately $35.8 million, or approximately
$41.5 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
based on the initial public offering price of $6.50 per share, and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

  •   approximately $17.5 million to fund clinical development of DN-101;

  •   approximately $7.5 million to fund clinical development of vinorelbine     
        oral; and                                                                  

  •   approximately $5.0 million to fund clinical development of AQ4N.

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering, if any, to,
among other things, fund pre-launch marketing preparations for our product
candidates, to identify new product candidates which we may in-license and for
general corporate purposes and working capital.

As of December 31, 2005, we had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities
of approximately $50.5 million. We expect our existing capital resources and the
net proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to enable us to maintain
currently planned operations through the end of 2007, including:

    •   initiating and conducting our Phase 3 clinical trial of DN-101 in AIPC;

    •   initiating and conducting our planned registration trial of vinorelbine    
        oral in metastatic breast cancer; and                                      

    •   initiating and conducting our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial of AQ4N in  
        glioblastoma multiforme.                                                   

We will need to raise substantial additional capital to fund our operations and
to complete development of our product candidates. We may obtain this funding
through a variety of means in the future, including through corporate partnering
arrangements and collaborations and through debt and equity financings.

The actual costs and timing of clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to
risk and may change depending upon the clinical indication targeted, the
development strategy pursued and the results of preclinical studies and earlier
clinical trials. The amounts and timing and the allocation of resources among
our existing clinical development programs, as well as our other expenditures,
will depend upon numerous factors, including the status of our product
development and commercialization efforts, the amount of proceeds actually
raised in this offering, competition, any strategic partnership arrangements we
may enter into and any additional product candidates we may in-license. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds
from this offering.

Depending on the length of our Phase 3 clinical trial of DN-101, our planned
registration trial of vinorelbine oral and our planned Phase 1/2 clinical trial
of AQ4N, which may be adversely affected by, among other things, slower than
anticipated patient enrollment, additional regulatory requirements and increases
in per-patient clinical trial costs due to trial design and efficacy issues, we
currently estimate that after completion of this offering we may need up to
$30.0 million to $37.5 million in additional funding to complete our Phase 3
clinical trial of DN-101, up to $5.0 million to $7.5 million in additional
funding to complete our planned registration trial of vinorelbine oral and up to
$5.0 million in additional funding to complete our planned Phase 1/2 clinical
trial of AQ4N.

By establishing a public market for our common stock, this offering is also
intended to facilitate our future access to public markets.

We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment
in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business. We
have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any
acquisitions or investments. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities or guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

full, based on the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share, and after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering in the
following manner:

    •   approximately $7 million for direct costs to complete the EVEREST trial;

    •   approximately $26 million to continue the development of our cortical      
        stimulation therapy system for applications other than stroke motor        
        recovery, including other clinical trials and research programs;

        support the commercial launch of our Northstar Stroke Recovery System; and 

    •   the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

The amounts we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our
expectations and will depend on a number of factors, including actual results of
our clinical trials, operating costs, capital expenditures and any expenses
related to defending claims of intellectual property infringement. Accordingly,
management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of
this offering. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used to acquire or
invest in complementary businesses, technologies, services or products. We have
no current plans, agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition
or investment, and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect
to any such transaction.

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

after giving effect to the transaction expenses described in (v) below
(approximately $392.9 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full) after deducting the underwriting discount and our estimated
expenses of the offering. None of the net proceeds of this offering will be used
to further invest in our business.

We intend to use the gross proceeds of $375.0 million from this offering for:

(i) the redemption of all of our currently outstanding preferred stock, of which
approximately $222.8 million in stated amount including accrued and unpaid
dividends thereon was outstanding as of the anticipated date of redemption of
May 9, 2006 (including preferred stock issued and the accrued and unpaid
dividend related to the working capital adjustment);

(ii) to pay a portion of the special Class B distribution in the amount of
$100.0 million upon consummation of the offering. We intend to use cash on hand
to pay a portion of the special Class B distribution;

(iii) the redemption, approximately 30 days after the consummation of this
offering, of $28.8 million aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated
notes;

(iv) the payment of certain prepayment penalties of approximately $8.4 million
as of December 30, 2005, $5.7 million of which represents prepayment penalties
on our preferred stock and $2.7 million of which represents prepayment penalties
on our senior subordinated notes; and

(v) the payment of transaction expenses of approximately $35.0 million which
includes a fee of $5.0 million paid to Veritas Capital Management II, LLC. To
the extent the equity proceeds are insufficient to pay transaction fees and
expenses, we may use up to $20.0 million of available cash on hand to pay fees
and expenses.

Our existing stockholder, DIV Holding LLC is the only holder of our Class B
common stock and, therefore, the only person entitled to receive the special
Class B distribution. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in
full to purchase additional shares, 50% of the amount of the net proceeds of
such exercise will be used to pay an additional special Class B distribution
upon consummation of the purchase and sale of such additional shares which is
expected to occur on or before June 15, 2006. 

As described under “Certain Relationships and Related Transactions,” Veritas
Capital will receive approximately $91.0 million, or 26.8%, of the net proceeds
of this offering, consisting of $86.0 million of the $100.0 million special
Class B distribution and a $5.0 million fee. In addition, to the extent that the
over-allotment option were exercised in full, assuming a distribution of the
additional special Class B distribution to its equity holders by DIV Holding
LLC, Veritas Capital would receive an additional $22.7 million. The amount of
the distribution to the holder of our Class B common stock which represents a
portion of our profit will depend on the distribution date.

Upon the earlier of the payment in full of the additional special Class B
distribution, if any, or the expiration of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option, if unexercised, the Class B common stock will automatically convert, on
a one-for-one basis into Class A common stock. The amount of the distribution to
the holder of our Class B common stock which represents a portion of our profit
will depend on the distribution date. Based on our accumulated net profits since
inception through December 30, 2005, the entire distribution to the holders of
our Class B common stock would be a return of capital.

The senior subordinated notes mature on February 15, 2013. Interest on the
senior subordinated notes accrues at the rate of 9.5% per annum (calculated
using a 360-day year) and is payable semi-annually on February 15 and August 15
of each year.

Assuming a redemption date of May 9, 2006, holders of our preferred stock will
receive $222.8 million, and we will redeem $28.8 million of the $320.0 million
aggregate principal amount of the senior subordinated notes."

    On April 27, 2005, we signed the promissory note payable to Delek Group Ltd.
described above in an original principal amount of $35.0 million. The proceeds
of this promissory note were used to partially fund the purchase of our Tyler
refinery. On November 23, 2005, we repaid $17.5 million of the principal and all
accrued interest on this note through the date of repayment.

    Although we continually evaluate acquisition opportunities, we have not
entered into any binding commitments or agreements with respect to future
acquisitions. Our management will have considerable discretion in the
application of the portion of the net proceeds that is to be available for
acquisitions, capital improvements and general corporate purposes as described
above. You will not have the opportunity, as part of your investment decision,
to assess whether the proceeds are being used appropriately. You must rely on
the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds of
this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds
of this offering in interest-bearing, short-term, investment grade, highly
liquid securities."

approximately $402.4 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, at the initial public offering price of $20.00 per share of
common stock, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us of approximately $26.1 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from the sale of the common stock from
this offering and the TPG Subscription, together with cash on hand of $8.4
million, to fund the Preferred Redemptions and pay costs, fees and expenses in
connection with the offering, the TPG Subscription, the Conversion and the
Preferred Redemptions. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option,
we intend to use a substantial portion of the net proceeds thereof to reduce our
borrowings under the New Term Loan. Any remaining net proceeds will be used for
general corporate purposes. Borrowings under the New Term Loan bear interest, at
our option, at a base rate plus a margin ranging from 0.75% to 1.25% or LIBOR
plus a margin ranging from 1.75% to 2.25%. Operating is required to make
quarterly amortization payments equal to 1.0% per annum of an amount equal to
(i) the outstanding New Term Loan principal amount less (ii) all voluntary
principal prepayments made by Operating. The remaining principal amount of the
New Term Loan will mature on the earlier of (a) the seventh anniversary of the
drawing and (b) six months prior to the maturity date or mandatory redemption
date (unless extended or repaid in accordance with their terms) of the 13 1/8%
Debentures, the 5.0% Notes Payable, the Series A Preferred Stock and the Series
B Preferred Stock.

from our sale of the 8,700,000 shares of common stock offered by us in this
offering, based upon the initial public offering price of $6.50 per share, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $59.8 million.
We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
that we receive in this offering for the payment of a $4.0 million license fee
that is due upon the closing of this offering and for general corporate
purposes, which may include:

   •   expansion of our domestic and international sales and marketing           
       organizations, which may include increasing the number of direct sales    
       personnel, expanding reseller and other sales relationships with third    
       parties, and investing in advertising and marketing activities to increase
       brand awareness;                                                          
  
   •   investments in our network infrastructure, which may include continuing to
       make significant upfront investments in network infrastructure equipment, 
       such as servers and other network devices, to support our customer base;  
  
   •   further development of our service offerings, which may include increasing
       the number of software engineering and quality assurance personnel; and   
  
   •   other corporate opportunities that may arise in the future.               

    We may use a portion of the proceeds that we receive in this offering for
possible acquisitions of complementary businesses, technologies or other assets.
We have no ongoing negotiations or current agreements or commitments with
respect to any material acquisitions.

    The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the cash used or generated in our operations, the status of
our development efforts, the level of sales and marketing activities,
technological advances and competitive pressures. We, therefore, cannot estimate
the amount of net proceeds that we receive in this offering which will be used
for any of the purposes described above. Pending the uses described above, we
plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

offering based on the sale of 8,823,529 shares at an initial offering price of
$14.00 per share after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated fees and expenses payable by us in connection with this offering. If
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we expect to
receive approximately $130.6 million in net proceeds from this offering based on
the sale of 10,147,058 shares at an initial offering price of $14.00 per share
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and fees and
expenses payable by us in connection with this offering.

    We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering, together with cash on
hand, to repay $115.0 million of indebtedness under our second lien credit
facility.

    On February 14, 2006, we entered into an amended and restated $235 million
senior secured credit facility and entered into our new $115 million second lien
credit facility. The proceeds of such amended and restated senior secured credit
facility and second lien credit facility were used to refinance our
then-existing indebtedness; pay an approximately $83.5 million dividend to our
stockholders; make an approximately $26.9 million cash payment to holders of our
stock options (including applicable payroll taxes of $0.5 million) in lieu of
adjusting exercise prices; pay the fees and expenses associated with our credit
facilities, and for working capital and general corporate purposes.

    Throughout this prospectus we refer to such amendment and restatement of our
senior secured credit facility in February 2006, entrance into the new second
lien credit facility, and the use of proceeds from the term borrowings under
each such facility, including the payment of a dividend of $83.5 million, and
the payment to holders of our stock options of $26.9 million in lieu of
adjusting exercise prices as the “recapitalization transactions.”

    The term loans under our senior secured credit facility have a maturity of
six years and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR
rate plus 3.0% per annum or a base rate plus 2.0% per annum. The revolving loans
under our senior secured credit facility have a maturity of five years and bear
interest initially, at our option (provided, that all swingline loans shall be
base rate loans), at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus 2.75% per annum
or a base rate plus 1.75% per annum, and, may decline to 2.00% for LIBOR loans
and 1.00% for base rate loans if certain leverage ratios are met. The term loans
under our second lien credit facility have a maturity of six and one half years
and bear interest, at our option, at a rate equal to an adjusted LIBOR rate plus
7.0% per annum or a base rate plus 6.0% per annum."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $40.3 million, or
approximately $46.5 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, based upon the initial public offering price of $10.00 per share and after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

      We currently expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:
     •     approximately $20.0 million to fund clinical trials and other        
           research and development activities for Orapem;                      
    
     •     approximately $12.0 million to fund future clinical trials for       
           REP8839;                                                             
    
     •     approximately $5.0 million to fund activities in preparation for the 
           potential commercial launch of Orapem; and                           
    
     •     the remainder, along with our available cash and cash equivalents,   
           short-term investments and interest earned, to fund working capital  
           and other general corporate purposes, including sales, general and   
           administrative expenses and potential further expansion of our       
           employee base and facilities, as well as amounts due to Daiichi      
           Asubio under our license agreement, which amounts are uncertain as to
           timing and dependent on the achievement of milestones.               

      We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the potential acquisition
of, or investment in, other product candidates, intellectual property rights or
companies that complement our business, although we have no current
understandings, commitments or agreements to do so.

      This expected use of net proceeds of this offering represents our current
intentions based upon our present plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds of this offering. Pending their uses,
we plan to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government.

      We do not expect the net proceeds from this offering alone to be
sufficient to fully support commercial scale operations if we successfully
commercialize Orapem or to fund the completion of development of our REP8839
product candidate, any product candidates generated from our discovery research
program or our Orapem product candidate for certain indications. We intend to
use our cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, funding received or
made available under our collaboration agreement with Forest Laboratories and
interest earned on these balances toward the additional funding necessary to
support these activities. If the funds provided by these sources are
insufficient to satisfy our future capital needs, or if we develop additional
products or pursue additional applications for our products, or conduct
additional clinical trials beyond those currently contemplated, we may seek to
sell additional equity or debt securities or acquire a credit facility. Any such
required additional capital may not be available on reasonable terms, if at all.
If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be required to modify
our planned research, development and commercialization strategy, which could
materially and adversely affect our business.

      The timing and costs to complete the successful development and
commercialization of any of our product candidates are highly uncertain and
therefore difficult to estimate. However, we expect that during the next
18 months we will be able to:

     •     complete our Phase III placebo-controlled clinical trial for Orapem  
           in the treatment of acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis;        
    
     •     complete our Phase II clinical trials for an oral liquid formulation 
           of Orapem among pediatric patients; and                              
    
     •     initiate and advance a Phase I clinical trial for a REP8839/mupirocin
           combination product for topical use for skin and wound infections and
           prevention of S. aureus infections, including MRSA infections, in    
           hospital settings.                                                   

      The lengthy process of seeking regulatory approvals for our product
candidates, and the subsequent compliance with applicable regulations, require
the expenditure of substantial resources. The actual costs and timing of
clinical trials are highly uncertain, subject to risk and may change depending
upon the clinical indication targeted, the development strategy pursued and the
results of preclinical studies and earlier clinical trials. The amounts and
timing of other expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, including the
status of our product development and commercialization efforts, timing and
outcomes of regulatory approvals, competition, manufacturing, and any strategic
partnership arrangements we may enter into. Because of these risks and
uncertainties, we cannot predict when or whether we will successfully obtain
regulatory approval for, or successfully commercialize, Orapem or complete the
development of any of our other product candidates or the ultimate costs of such
efforts. Whether we will need to raise additional funds to complete the
development of any of our product candidates or market any products is directly
affected by these risks and uncertainties, as well as a variety of factors
discussed under “Risk Factors” elsewhere in this prospectus.

      We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our
existing cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, funding received
from our collaboration agreements and interest earned on these balances, will be
sufficient to satisfy our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital
expenditures through at least the next 18 months."

this offering will be approximately $41.1 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $47.3 million.

    We will use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate
purposes. Those purposes may include, among other things, meeting our working
capital needs and providing investments in our bank subsidiaries to support our
growth, including development of additional banking offices. Additionally, we
may use the net proceeds to finance bank acquisitions, though we have no present
plans in that regard.

    We have not specifically allocated the amount of the net proceeds that will
be used for these purposes; however, we believe that we will be able to deploy
the net proceeds of this offering in a manner that will maximize the return to 
our investors. We are effecting this offering at this time because we believe 
that based on our current financial position and considering our historical 
growth and development and our prospects for the future, we have reached a 
stage where we are ready to be a public company with access to the public markets. 

    The precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds will depend
upon market conditions and the availability of other funds, among other factors.
From time to time, we may engage in additional capital financings as we
determine to be appropriate based upon our needs and prevailing market
conditions. These additional capital financings may include the sale of
securities other than, or in addition to, common stock."

of common stock offered by us will be approximately $18.2 million, based on an
initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase 825,000 additional
shares of common stock in full, our net proceeds will be approximately
$25.1 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of
common stock by our selling stockholders. Our chief executive officer and our
chief technical officer are each offering approximately 5% of their holdings in
this offering. The principal purposes for this offering are to increase our
working capital, create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our
future access to the public capital markets and increase our visibility in our
markets. We selected a primary offering size that we believe should be adequate
to enable us to execute on our business plan for at least the next 18 to
24 months. We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures. We may
also use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary
technologies, businesses or other assets. We have no current agreements or
commitments with respect to any material acquisitions. We do not have more
specific plans for the net proceeds from this offering.

    We have not yet determined all of our expected expenditures, and we cannot
estimate the amounts to be used for each purpose set forth above. The amounts
and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash
generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the
rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending
use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds
of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

(1) Assumes that 358,750 shares sold in the conversion offering are purchased by 
    officers, employees and directors of Educators and EHC and members of their  
    households, and that 10% of the shares are sold to the ESOP.                 

After the payment of our offering expenses, we will use the net proceeds
received from the sale of our shares of common stock in the conversion offering
to make a loan to our ESOP in an amount sufficient to permit the plan to buy up
to 10% of the shares sold in the conversion offering.

We will use approximately $40.2 million of the net proceeds to pay the cash
portion of the consideration in the merger. Assuming shareholder approval of a
proposed stock compensation plan at least six months after the conversion
offering is complete, we intend to use funds to purchase in the open market 4%
of the shares of common stock sold in the conversion offering, which will be
used to make restricted stock awards under the stock compensation plan.
Depending on market conditions, shares purchased for use in the stock
compensation plan may not be repurchased at $10.00 per share. In the event that
the price of our common stock has increased, the cost of the shares purchased
for use in the stock compensation plan will be greater. Finally, we will retain 
any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which likely will 
include contributing additional capital to the domestic insurance company  
subsidiaries of EHC to support expansion of their underwriting capacity.

Net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion offering may be
more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds also will vary if the number
of shares to be issued in the conversion offering is adjusted to reflect a
change in Educators’ estimated pro forma market value."

connection with the offering, are estimated to be $14,308,482 if the underwriter
does not exercise the over-allotment option and $16,491,432 if the underwriter
exercises the over-allotment option, in each case based upon (i) an offering
price of $22.00 per share and (ii) that approximately 29% of the shares are sold
to existing stockholders and employees at an underwriting discount of 1.5% and
approximately 71% of the shares are sold to persons or entities who are not
existing stockholders at an underwriting discount of 5.5%. The aggregate
underwriting discount payable for the shares sold in this offering is $670,718,
excluding the over-allotment option.

We anticipate initially contributing a minimum of $12,000,000 in additional
capital to the Bank to assist in funding its growth and expansion plans. The
Bank will immediately use these proceeds to pay down short-term advances at the
Federal Home Loan Bank, and then to fund future loan growth and for general
corporate purposes, including de novo branching and possible acquisitions of
financial institutions. The Company will invest the remaining funds in
short-duration investment securities to provide flexibility in case acquisition
or expansion opportunities present themselves or additional capital needs at the
Bank arise. There are currently no agreements or understandings with respect to
potential acquisitions of other financial institutions.

If market conditions warrant, the Bank may leverage the additional capital in
short-duration investment securities in order to take advantage of a possible
higher rate environment in future periods compared to what the existing
portfolio is yielding. It is the Bank’s ultimate intention to leverage the
capital through corporate expansion and loan growth. However, the Bank will look
at alternatives to increase earnings and use those increased earnings and the
cash flow from new and current investments to fund future loan growth."

(1)  Our new senior secured credit facility is expected to provide for a         
     $65.0 million revolving credit facility.                                    
    
(2)  We are required to give at least 30 days prior notice prior to redeeming the
     senior secured notes. This amount assumes a redemption date of April 1,     
     2006. Promptly following the closing of this offering, we intend to issue a 
     notice of redemption. Assuming the senior secured notes are redeemed on     
     July 15, 2006, the amount required to redeem the notes would increase to    
     $94.4 million requiring anticipated additional borrowings of approximately  
     $1.5 million under our new senior secured credit facility as of that date.  
    
(3)  Consists of a one-time $3.0 million fee to terminate our management         
     consulting agreement with First Atlantic Capital, Ltd. upon completion of   
     this offering. The management consulting agreement currently obligates us to
     pay approximately $600,000 per year, plus expenses, to First Atlantic       
     Capital, Ltd. until 2012.                                                   
    
(4)  Transaction fees and expenses include: (i) $7.8 million related to the      
     underwriting discount and fees and expenses associated with this offering,  
     and (ii) fees and expenses of approximately $1.0 million related to our new 
     senior secured credit facility.                                             

      The 8.375% senior secured notes have a final maturity date of October 15,
2009, although we are required by the indenture governing the notes to make the
principal payments on the notes of $18.75 million in 2007 and $9.375 million in
2008.
      Interest on outstanding borrowings under our existing senior secured
credit facility is payable, at our option, at either an index rate or a LIBOR
rate. Index rate loans bear interest at a floating rate equal to the higher of
(i) the base rate on corporate loans quoted by The Wall Street Journal or
(ii) the federal funds rate plus 50 basis points per annum, in either case plus
1.00%. LIBOR rate loans bear interest at a rate based on LIBOR plus 2.50%. We
have the option to choose 1-, 2-, 3- or 6-month LIBOR periods for borrowings
bearing interest at the LIBOR rate. In addition, the existing senior secured
credit facility requires us to pay a monthly fee of 2.50% per annum of the
amount available under outstanding letters of credit. We are also required to
pay a monthly commitment fee equal to 0.5% per annum of the undrawn
availability, as calculated under the agreement. Amounts currently outstanding
under the existing senior secured credit facility are due and payable in
April 2007 and bear interest at a rate of 8.5%."

offering will be approximately $49.9 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $13.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds
from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

    We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering to reduce
existing indebtedness under our current credit facility, including repaying
$9.4 million of the Term B Note due May 1, 2007 and paying down $40.5 million of
the outstanding balance under our revolving loan, which expires May 1, 2007. The
Term B Note bears interest at 1.25% over the lender's base rate, and the
revolving loan bears interest at 0.25% over the lender's base rate. In
accordance with our credit agreement, we have converted a portion of these
borrowings to LIBOR loans, which bear interest, in the case of the Term B Note,
at 2.75% over LIBOR and, in the case of our revolving loan, at 1.75% over LIBOR.
Amounts repaid under the revolving loan may be redrawn from time to time for
general corporate purposes, including acquisitions. In the last 12 months, we
borrowed under our revolving loan to pay a $20.0 million special dividend and to
fund working capital."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be $47.0 million, based
on an initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that we
will receive net proceeds of $54.6 million.

Of the net proceeds that we will receive from this offering, we expect to use
approximately:

   •  $28.2 million for repayment of outstanding debt to FFC Partners II, L.P. and
      FFC Executive Partners II, L.P.; and                                        
  
   •  $15.0 million for sales and marketing initiatives to support the ongoing    
      commercialization of our products.                                          

We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds for research and development
activities and general corporate purposes. We may use a portion of our net
proceeds to acquire and invest in complementary products, technologies or
businesses; however, we currently have no agreements or commitments to complete
any such transaction and are not involved in negotiations to do so. Pending
these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds from this offering primarily in
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.

Pursuant to a subordinated debt agreement entered into in December 2003, we are
obligated to repay outstanding debt to FFC Partners II, L.P. and FFC Executive
Partners II, L.P., with proceeds from this offering, which as of March 31, 2006,
was $28.2 million. This debt accrues interest at a rate of 15.0% per annum
compounded and payable in arrears. As permitted by the agreement, interest has
been capitalized as part of the note principal and bears interest at the same
rate as the note principal. This debt matures in December 2008.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering. The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several
factors, including cash flows from our operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of
our management regarding the application of the proceeds from this offering. We
reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain
contingencies such as the results of our commercialization efforts, competitive
developments, opportunities to acquire products, technologies or businesses and
other factors."

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses that we must pay. We
will not receive any of the proceeds of the sale of shares of common stock by
the selling stockholders.

    The primary purposes of the offering are to fund the expansion of our
business and to create a public market for our common stock. Part of our current
growth strategy is to further penetrate the North American markets and to
possibly expand our customer base internationally. We anticipate that a portion
of the proceeds of this offering will enable us to finance this expansion. In
addition, we could use a portion of the proceeds of this offering to make
strategic investments in, or pursue acquisitions of, other businesses, products
or technologies. We do not presently have any plans, proposals or arrangements,
written or otherwise, to acquire companies or technologies, nor are we currently
contemplating any significant capital expenditures. Our management will have
broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. The
amounts actually expended and the timing of such expenditures will depend on a
number of factors, including our realization of the different elements of our
growth strategy and the amount of cash generated by our operations.

    Pending use of proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the proceeds
in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments."

sale of the 11,000,000 shares of common stock offered by us in this offering,

expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of
shares by the selling shareholders.

    We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering, estimated at
$232.2 million, to finance a portion of the construction costs of our
Northwestern Iowa Facility and our Welcome Facility at an estimated aggregate
cost of $280.0 million, with the balance of $47.8 million expected to come from
cash-on-hand and cash generated from operations during the construction period.

    The amounts and timing of these expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the federal, state and local permitting and licensing
process, the construction schedules of our contractors, the delivery of goods
and equipment by our suppliers and various other considerations typically
associated with large-scale construction projects. A portion of the proceeds
also may be used for general corporate purposes. Pending any use as described
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in investment-grade, short-term,
interest-bearing securities."

offering will be approximately $119 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $15.00 per share, and after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions. If the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares, we expect to receive approximately $18 million of additional
net proceeds. In addition, Agilent has agreed to make a payment or other
transfer of value to us (which could include, for example, forgiveness of our
loan from Agilent or credits for transition services to be provided to us by
Agilent) after the closing of this offering in an amount equal to approximately
$21.4 million ($3.6 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to
purchase additional shares), the amount by which the net proceeds of this
offering are less than $140 million.

     The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital
and to create a public market for our ordinary shares. We anticipate that we
will use $25 million of the net proceeds from this offering to repay our
$25 million short-term revolving credit facility from Agilent that we entered
into on the date of our separation from Agilent. We borrowed $25 million from
Agilent under this facility. The loan from Agilent bears interest at one-month
LIBOR plus 50 basis points (equal to 5.54% as of April 28, 2006). The amounts
borrowed under the credit facility will mature on the 30th day after the closing
of this offering. We will also reimburse Agilent for approximately $7 million of
payments that Agilent made on our behalf related to future severance, pension
and flexible time off liabilities associated with employees transferred to
Flextronics under the various Flextronics asset purchase agreements described
elsewhere in this prospectus. These amounts are required to be repaid within
30 days after the closing of this offering. We also expect to use $1 million of
the proceeds of this offering to make a payment related to the pension and
flexible time off liabilities related to the employees transferred to
Flextronics by June 30, 2006. We expect to use the remaining approximately
$107 million for general corporate purposes, including working capital, and to
pay approximately $40 million in costs we expect to incur through the end of
fiscal 2006 related to our separation from Agilent.

     Pending such uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds in highly liquid,
investment grade securities. By establishing a public market for our ordinary
shares, this offering is also intended to facilitate our future access to the
public markets."

receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling

    We have no current specific plan for the use of the proceeds of the offering
or a significant portion thereof. The principal reasons for this offering are to
increase our working capital, create a public market for our common stock,
provide liquidity for our existing stockholders, improve our ability to access
the capital markets in the future and for general corporate purposes. If the
opportunity arises, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering
to acquire or invest in businesses, products or technologies that are
complementary to our own, as we did in October 2004 when we acquired BizBuySell.
We have no agreements or commitments for any acquisitions or investments.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the cash used or generated in our operations, the status of
our sales and marketing activities, product development efforts, and competitive
pressures. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds to be used
for all of the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or advisable
to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in
the application of the net proceeds. Pending the use of the net proceeds, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, investment-grade,

(1)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds loaned to  
     us by Community Bankers LLC as described below. These funds will be repaid  
     out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon         
     consummation of this offering. The amounts shown are estimates only and our 
     actual expenditures may differ from those set forth herein.                 

(2)  This amount includes $2,100,000 of the underwriting discount ($0.28 per     
     unit), equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering, which the      
     underwriters have agreed will be deferred and paid to the underwriters only 
     upon the consummation of a business combination, less $0.28 for each share  
     converted to cash in connection with our business combination. If a business
     combination is not consummated, such deferred underwriting discount will be 
     forfeited by the underwriters. The underwriters will not be entitled to any 
     interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discount.                     
    
(3)  Of these estimated expenditures, $600,000 will be funded from the offering  
     proceeds not held in trust and $500,000 of such expenditures will be funded 
     from the interest earned on the funds held in trust which is released to us 
     periodically. In the event the over-allotment option is exercised in full,  
     $690,000 of the estimated expenditures will be funded from the offering     
     proceeds not held in trust and $725,000 funded from the interest earned on  
     the funds held in trust. In the event that we do not consummate a business  
     combination, our remaining proceeds will be allocated to pay the costs of   
     our liquidation and dissolution. If our remaining assets outside of the     
     trust fund are not sufficient to pay the costs of our liquidation and       
     dissolution, Messrs. Simanson and Zalman will be obligated to pay such      
     costs.                                                                      

    $56,450,000, or $65,090,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the net proceeds will be placed into an interest-bearing
trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock
Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. These proceeds consist of $54,350,000
($7.24 per unit) or $62,675,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in
full and $2,100,000 ($0.28 per unit) of the deferred underwriting discount
($2,415,000 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in full).
Except for a portion of the interest earned on the trust account that may be
released to us, these proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until
the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as part of our
dissolution approved by our stockholders and our plan of distribution in
connection with our liquidation.

    The net proceeds of this offering held in the trust account and moneys held
by us and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be
invested in “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the
United States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act of
1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under that act. A
portion of the interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be paid to us periodically as described in this
prospectus and used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed. The
interest rate earned on the trust account will be the prevailing interest rate
on short-term U.S. treasury securities and money market funds that comply with
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 of the Investment Company Act of 1940. These
rates will vary from time to time. On April 20, 2006, the yield on 30-day
treasury bills was approximately 4.5% per annum. Based on such prevailing rates,
we believe that the income received by the trust fund will be sufficient to
provide the contemplated amount of working capital. However, this offering is
not intended for persons who are seeking a return on investments in government
securities. The escrow account and the purchase of government securities for the
account is intended as a holding place for funds pending the earlier to occur of
either (i) the consummation of our primary business objective, which is a
business combination, or (ii) absent a business combination, our dissolution and
return of the funds held in this account.

    The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination. One-half of the interest earned on the trust account, net of taxes,
will be retained in the trust account for distribution as described below. The
remaining interest, net of taxes, up to $1,129,000 ($1,302,000 in the event of
the exercise of the overallotment option in full) may be released to us
periodically to fund our working capital requirements. In addition, trust funds
will be released to us periodically to pay income taxes on interest earned on
the trust funds. Holders of common stock whose shares are converted to cash in
connection with our initial business combination will receive their pro rata
portion of the amount held in trust ($7.52 per share) plus the pro rata portion
of any interest not released to us, net of taxes. In the event that we do not
consummate a business combination in a timely manner and assuming our
dissolution is approved by our stockholders in accordance with Delaware law, 
holders of our common stock sold in this offering will be entitled to receive their 
proportionate share of the trust fund (including any interest not released to us, 
net of taxes, and the deferred underwriting discount), In addition, such holders will 
be entitled to receive a pro rata portion of our remaining assets not held in trust, 
less amounts we pay, or reserve to pay, for all of our liabilities and obligations.
These liabilities and obligations include our corporate expenses arising during
our remaining existence and the costs associated with our dissolution and
liquidation. Our corporate expenses are expected to be primarily associated with
preparation for and conduct of our special meeting of stockholders and our
continuing public reporting obligations, including legal services, proxy
soliciting firms, services of our independent public accounting firm as well as
legal fees we may incur in the event of disputes with any claimants or
creditors. Messrs. Simanson and Zalman will be responsible to ensure that the
trust funds are not reduced by claims of our vendors and service providers in
the event of our dissolution and liquidation. Other than the interest income
that may be released to us to fund our working capital requirements and to pay
income taxes on interest earned on the trust funds, the proceeds held in the
trust account (exclusive of any proceeds attributable to the deferred
underwriters’ discount) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a
target business with which we ultimately complete a business combination and, to
the extent not used for these purposes, released to us upon completion of a
business combination. Any amounts in the trust fund not paid as consideration to
the sellers of the target business, other than amounts held in trust or paid to
the representatives of the underwriters for services as representatives of the
underwriters, may be used to pay remaining expenses of the business combination,
including reimbursement of expenses of our officers and directors incurred in
connection therewith to the extent funds not held in trust were insufficient to
do so, to pay any finders’ fees or financing fees, if any, and to finance the
ongoing operations of the target business or to effect other acquisitions, in
each case as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    We intend to use the majority of the net proceeds of this offering not being
held in trust in our efforts to acquire a target business, including identifying
and evaluating prospective acquisition candidates, selecting the target
business, and structuring, negotiating and consummating the business
combination. Of these net proceeds, we will reserve approximately $200,000 for
due diligence of prospective target businesses payable to non-affiliates and, to
the extent incurred, reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel
expenses) incurred by our officers, directors and stockholders who assist us in
connection with seeking and selecting a target business and performing due
diligence activities. None of these persons or any of their affiliates will
receive any compensation for their activities in connection with the business
combination. We intend to use the excess working capital shown above
(approximately $270,000) together with any additional interest released to us,
for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $180,000 in
the aggregate) and other operating expenses.

    It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to
make a deposit or down payment or to fund a “no shop” provision with respect to
a particular business combination, although we do not have any current intention
to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds or
any of the funds are not returned to us (whether as a result of our breach of
the agreement relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have sufficient
remaining working capital outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence
and pay other expenses related to finding another suitable business combination
without securing additional financing. In that event and if we are unable to
secure additional working capital, we would most likely fail to consummate a
business combination in the allotted time and would be required to promptly
begin the process for our dissolution and liquidation in accordance with the
requirements of Delaware law. We may also use a portion of our excess working
capital to pay finders’ fees in connection with a business combination, although
we do not presently intend to engage finders to identify suitable transactions.
The balance, if any, of our working capital will be held in reserve in the event
that due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates. We believe that our
working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs.

    To the extent that our capital stock or debt is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund (other than funds attributable to the underwriters’ discount) that are not 
used for such purpose, as well as any other net proceeds not expended, will be 
used to finance the operations of the target business, including satisfaction 
of any regulatory mandated or ongoing capital requirements, or to effect other 
acquisitions, as determined by our board of directors at that time.

    Community Bankers Acquisition, LLC, an affiliate of Mr. Simanson, our
president, and Mr. Zalman, a stockholder, has entered into a non-interest
bearing revolving credit agreement with us in the amount of $100,000. Advances
under the credit facility will be used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above including professional fees. The
loan will be payable without interest on the consummation of this offering.
Advances under the revolving credit agreement amounted to $20,000 as of
March 31, 2006 and $40,000 as of the date of this prospectus. The loan will be
repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

    The payment to Community Bankers Acquisition, LLC of a monthly fee of $7,500
is for general and administrative services including office space, utilities,
and secretarial support. Although the monthly rents and fees were arbitrarily
arrived at, we believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the
Alexandria, Virginia area, that the fees charged by Community Bankers
Acquisition, LLC are at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination or our
liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

    We reserve the right, at the discretion of the board of directors, to
reallocate our use of the net proceeds of this offering not held in trust among
the legal, due diligence and working capital items in response to the timing and
extent of due diligence and legal and regulatory requirements and, in the event
that we do not consummate a business combination, to reallocate any remaining
proceeds to the costs of our liquidation and dissolution. If our remaining
assets outside of the trust fund are not sufficient to pay the costs of
liquidation and dissolution, Messrs. Simanson and Zalman will be obligated to
pay such costs. The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and
not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only
in United States government securities within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 including treasury bills issued by the U.S.
maturing within 180 days or less, or other high-quality, short-term
interest-bearing investments so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended. The interest
income derived from investment of these net proceeds not held in the trust fund
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the date of this prospectus through the consummation of the
acquisition of a target business, we will pay Community Bankers Acquisition, LLC
the fee described above. In addition, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
attending management or board meetings, and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee and
reimbursement of our existing stockholders for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, no compensation of
any kind, including finder’s and consulting fees, will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination. To
the extent that the out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust fund, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate a business combination. Since the role of present management after
a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination. In the event that no business combination is consummated within the
allotted time, the entire trust fund will be returned to the holders of the
common stock sold in this offering without any such deduction.

    A holder of common stock sold in this offering, other than our existing
stockholders, will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund, including
interest not released to us (net of taxes payable on income from the funds in
the trust account) earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund, only in
the event of our dissolution and liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time or if that stockholder were to
seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination
which the stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no
other circumstances will a stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to
or in the trust fund."

our common stock in this offering of approximately $90.1 million, based on an
initial public offering price of $13.00 per share and after deducting estimated
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. See the
“Underwriting” section of this prospectus. We will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of shares by any of the selling stockholders.

    We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering, together with
cash on hand, to:
   •  consummate the tender offer for up to $85.0 million aggregate principal     
      amount of TSI, Inc.’s senior notes;                                         
  
   •  redeem up to 35% of our senior discount notes; and                          
  
   •  pay related fees, premiums and expenses.                                    

    On a pro forma basis after giving effect to this offering and our
application of the net proceeds therefrom, our consolidated debt as of March 31,
2006 would have been approximately $282.8 million.

    The indenture governing our senior discount notes permits us to use the net
cash proceeds from this offering to redeem up to 35% of the original principal
amount of our senior discount notes. Also, under TSI, Inc.’s credit facility, we
are required to maintain a minimum amount of unrestricted cash on hand. The pro
forma information that we present in this prospectus assumes that we will redeem
30.0% of the original principal amount of our senior discount notes. This
represents the largest amount of the original principal amount of our senior
discount notes that could be redeemed as of March 31, 2006 with the remaining
net cash proceeds from this offering after using a portion of our cash on hand
as of March 31, 2006 and a portion of our net proceeds from this offering to
consummate the tender offer for TSI, Inc.’s senior notes and paying related fees
and expenses. To the extent we can consummate the tender offer using additional
cash on hand as of the date of consummation in lieu of the net proceeds from
this offering, we will then use such net proceeds toward the redemption of our
senior discount notes up to the 35% maximum redeemable percentage.
    Pending the use described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of
this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be approximately $18.0
million, based on an initial public offering price of $6.00 per share after
deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that we
will receive additional net proceeds of approximately $2.9 million.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering principally to fund further
development and expansion of our products and product candidates, in particular
our nanomaterial and ultrasound-related product candidates, and for general
working capital purposes. Specifically, in 2006 and 2007 we currently estimate
spending:

      †    approximately $4 million to $6 million to develop disease-targeting MRI 
           contrast agents and other nanomaterial applications through completion  
           of pre-clinical trials and the filing of an Investigational New Drug    
           application for a lead contrast agent;                                  

      †    approximately $2 million to $3 million to complete FDA Phase I clinical 
           trials for one lead disease-targeting MRI contrast agent including      
           generation of preliminary efficacy data;                                

      †    approximately $2 million to $3 million to complete technological        
           development of our first medical device product based on our innovative 
           ultrasound platform technology which is necessary to commence the       
           regulatory review and approval process; and                             

      †    an additional $2 million to $3 million to fund studies necessary to     
           commence and complete the 510(k) premarketing notification review       
           process with the FDA to allow us to market in the U.S. our first medical
           device product based on our innovative ultrasound platform technology.  

Thereafter, we intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to continue to
fund FDA clinical trials of additional, currently unidentified, MRI contrast
agent and ultrasound medical device products, with the remainder being available
for general working capital purposes. However, due to the uncertainties inherent
in the clinical trial process and given that our product candidates have not yet
entered clinical development, we are unable to estimate the total costs that
will be required to complete the development of our product candidates. As a
result, we cannot estimate what amount of the net proceeds will be available for
general working capital purposes.

Moreover, our current estimates may change as we begin to develop and expand our
product candidates, and we may decide to use our net proceeds for other product
candidates or other business purposes. In addition, we may decide to fund our
development efforts in part or in whole through outside sources, including
licensing revenues or other sources of financing. The foregoing use of proceeds
are only our current estimates, and we retain broad discretion to change the
application of the proceeds from this offering.

We have not made specific plans with respect to the remaining proceeds of this
offering and, therefore, cannot specify all uses for the net proceeds.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion over the use of the net
proceeds in this offering. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
will depend upon numerous factors, including the status of our development and
commercialization efforts and the amount of proceeds actually raised in this
offering.

Additional purposes of this offering are to establish a public market for our
common stock and to facilitate our future access to public markets, if, for
example, additional funds are required to complete FDA clinical trials. We may
also use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or investment in,
companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our business. We
have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any
acquisitions or investments. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net
proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment-grade interest-bearing
securities or guaranteed obligations of the United States government."

----------
(1)  A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee,
NASD filing fee, AMEX filing fee and approximately $85,000 of legal and
accounting fees, have been paid from the $225,000 loan from our officers and
directors, as further described below. These funds will be repaid out of the net
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
offering.

(2)  Consists of an underwriting discount of 7% of the gross proceeds of this
offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) including 2%, or
$3,000,000 to be held in trust ($3,450,000 if the underwriter’s overallotment
option is exercised in full) until consumation of a business combination.

(3)  The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $1,575,000
even if the over-allotment is exercised. We currently estimate that we would
require approximately $50,000 to $75,000 to implement our stockholder approved
plan of dissolution and distribution in the event we do not consummate a
business combination.

$142,575,000, or $163,950,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the net proceeds of this offering and the purchase of the
founding warrants, will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan Chase NY Bank
maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities,”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, or
in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated
under the Investment Company Act, having a maturity of one hundred and eighty
days or less, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act of 1940. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or as part
of any plan of dissolution and distribution approved by our stockholders which
would include liquidation of our trust account, except that to the extent the
trust account earns interest or we are deemed to have earned income in
connection therewith, we will be permitted to seek disbursements from the trust
account to pay any federal, state or local tax obligations related thereto. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a business
combination.

We have agreed to pay Value Investments, LLC, an affiliated third party of which
Bruce Lederman, our executive vice president and secretary, is the managing
member, up to $7,500 per month for office space, utilities, administrative,
technology and secretarial services. This arrangement is being agreed to by
Value Investments, LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Mr. Lederman compensation in lieu of salary. We believe, based on rents and fees
for similar services in the Los Angeles area, that the fee charged by Value
Investments, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of a
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
stockholders.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $1,575,000. We intend to use the
working capital (approximately $570,000) for director and officer liability
insurance premiums (approximately $100,000), with the balance of $470,000 being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by any of our
existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf. We believe
that the working capital and proceeds from our limited recourse line of credit
will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to engage
consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also
use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to
fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep
target businesses from “shopping around” for transactions with other companies
on terms more favorable to such target business) with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. If we entered into such a letter of intent where we paid for the right to
receive exclusivity from a target business, the amount that would be used as a
down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account and other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, certain of our officers and directors have
loaned us a total of $225,000, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses
of this offering, such as transfer agent fees, SEC registration fees, NASD 
registration fees, AMEX listing fees and legal and accounting fees and expenses. 
The $225,000 loan from certain of our officers and directors will be payable 
without interest on the earlier of December 13, 2006 or the consummation of 
the offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not 
being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended. By restricting the investment of the proceeds of this offering to
these instruments, we intend to avoid being deemed to be an investment company
within the meaning of the Investment Company Act. Notwithstanding our belief
that we are not required to comply with the requirements of such act, in the
event that the stockholders do not approve a plan of dissolution and
distribution and the funds remain in the trust account for an indeterminable
amount of time, we may be considered to be an investment company and thus
required to comply with such act. The interest income derived from investment of
these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering,
we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24
months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that
time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Value Investments, LLC the
$7,500 monthly fee described above. Other than this fee, no compensation of any
kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders or to any of their officers and directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust account)
only in the event of the liquidation of our trust account as part of our plan of
dissolution and distribution approved by our stockholders upon our failure to
complete a business combination or if that public stockholder were to convert
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

common stock in this offering will be approximately $71.4 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $9.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering costs. If the over-allotment
option is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $83.1 million.

    We expect to use $26.3 million of the net proceeds from this offering to
expand our sales and marketing activities, to support our research and
development efforts, to fund the clearance or approval and subsequent
commercialization of our near-term product candidates, and to acquire
complementary businesses, products, or technologies, or to obtain the right to
use such complementary technologies. We have no present understandings,
commitments or agreements to acquire any businesses products or technologies.

    Based on the amounts outstanding at March 31, 2006, we anticipate using
approximately $9.4 million of the net proceeds of this offering to reduce our
outstanding indebtedness as follows:

        º approximately $6.8 million to reduce current amounts outstanding under
          our $10.0 million revolving credit facility with Bank of the West,
          which may be reborrowed; and

        º approximately $2.6 million to repay a loan from the Chairman,
          President and Chief Executive Officer of Alphatec Pacific, which bears
          an effective interest rate of 18.46% to its scheduled maturity and is
          payable in monthly installments through May 2007.

    We will use approximately $35.7 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to satisfy redemption and dividend obligations to our existing
stockholders, which will be approximately $100.4 million on June 7, 2006. Of
such proceeds, $30.0 million will be used to satisfy our aggregate redemption
obligations, and $5.7 million will be used to satisfy our aggregate dividend
obligations.

    Our estimated offering costs include $1.0 million to pay an advisory fee,
and approximately $0.2 million to pay out of pocket costs which may be incurred,
to HealthpointCapital, LLC, an affiliate of HealthpointCapital.

    Pursuant to the terms of our certificate of incorporation, we are entitled
to retain 50% of the net proceeds from this offering, excluding any proceeds
from the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option, up to $65 million.
We are required to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering to satisfy
redemption and dividend obligations to holders of our outstanding Series A
preferred stock, Series A-1 preferred stock, Series B preferred stock, Rolling
common stock, Series A common stock, Series A-1 common stock, Series B common
stock, and Series C common stock. To the extent those obligations exceed the
remaining net proceeds from this offering, we are required to issue a
combination of common stock and New Redeemable preferred stock to satisfy those
obligations. We will not issue more than $30 million of New Redeemable preferred
stock. In addition, we are required to use all of the net proceeds from any
exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option to redeem any outstanding
shares of New Redeemable preferred stock.

    The amounts that we actually expend for operating and working capital
purposes may vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including the
timing and success of any FDA clearances we may seek in the future, the timing
of regulatory submissions, the status and timing of our research and development
efforts, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the amount of
cash generated by our operations, the amount of competition we face and the
success we have with obtaining any required technology or licenses and entering
into collaboration arrangements. As a result, management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

    All of our calculations involving the payment in the reorganization
transactions of the accrued and unpaid dividends on each of our series of common
stock for a combination of cash, common stock and New Redeemable preferred 
stock are based on the amount of accrued and unpaid dividends on our series of 
common stock through June 7, 2006.

    Of the net proceeds of this offering to be used to satisfy our redemption
and dividend obligations to our existing stockholders, approximately
$22.6 million will be paid to our executive officers, key employees and
principal stockholders.

    Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in short-term investment grade and U.S. government securities."

offering will be approximately $94 million, based on the initial public offering
price of $14.00 per share and after deduction of underwriting fees and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use such net proceeds to implement our growth strategy through the
possible acquisition of additional broadcast platforms, possible geographic
expansion through an acquisition elsewhere in the Commonwealth of Independent
States, and/or the possible acquisition of television programming on a
proprietary rather than licensed basis. We have not yet identified any specific
acquisitions, and therefore cannot estimate the amount of proceeds that will be
used for this purpose.

Approximately $22 million of the net proceeds to us will be used for the
repayment of outstanding indebtedness to Alfa Bank, an affiliate of one of our
principal stockholders. This indebtedness bears interest at a weighted average
rate of 10.2% per year and matures between June 2006 and October 2006. See
‘‘Relationships and Transactions with Related Parties — Transactions with Alfa —
Loans from Alfa to CTC.’’ A portion of such indebtedness was incurred within the
past year and has been used to fund acquisitions of owned-and-operated stations
and working capital.

Any remaining net proceeds of the offering will be used for general corporate
purposes, which may include the purchase of an office building in Moscow to
consolidate our Moscow operations and corporate headquarters, or the build-out
of a new leasehold property in Moscow. We will not receive any proceeds from the
sale of shares by the selling stockholders."
