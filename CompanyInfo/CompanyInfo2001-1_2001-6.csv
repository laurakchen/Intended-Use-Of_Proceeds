if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based upon an
assumed offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting estimated

purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital and to create a
public market for our common stock. We expect to use:
  . Approximately $11.7 million of the net proceeds to prepay our $8.0
    million term loan and repay approximately $3.7 million of revolving
    credit advances outstanding under our term loan and revolving credit
    facility;
  . Approximately $0.5 million of the net proceeds for marketing and related
    expenditures to increase our brand awareness and to support the
    implementation of our business strategy;

  . The balance of the net proceeds for working capital and other general
    corporate purposes.
  We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire products or businesses
related to the coffee industry; however, we currently have no commitments or
agreements relating to any of these types of transactions. We will have
significant discretion in the use of the net proceeds of this offering.
Investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the proceeds of this offering. Pending use of the net proceeds
as discussed above, we intend to invest these funds in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment-grade obligations.
  Pursuant to the terms of our term loan and revolving credit facility, we are
required to use the proceeds of this offering to prepay our $8.0 million term
loan and repay our outstanding revolving credit advances. Our $8.0 million term
loan matures on February 28, 2002 and bears interest at either the Index rate
(the higher of prime or 50 basis points over the average of rates for overnight
federal funds transactions) plus 5.25% or the London Interbank Offered Rate
(LIBOR) plus 7.00%. As of October 1, 2000, the interest rate is 14.0%. Our
revolving credit facility expires on August 31, 2005 and the advances
thereunder bear interest at either the Index rate plus 1.25% or LIBOR plus
3.00%. As of October 1, 2000, the interest rate is 10.0%. A more complete
discussion of the terms of our term loan and revolving credit facility is
included in ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
Results of Operations.""
  Proceeds from additional indebtedness incurred over the past year under our
credit facility were primarily used to build and open nine retail stores, to
add new production equipment to our roasting facility, and to deploy the
necessary computer equipment to strengthen our systems infrastructure."

deductions. We estimate that the proceeds from the issuance of 5,401,970 shares
of our common stock from the exercise of the stock purchase rights held by the

their over-allotment option to purchase additional shares, estimated net
proceeds that we will receive from the offering will increase to approximately
$9.945 million.
    
 
    We plan to use the net proceeds from the offering as follows:
 
                                                                      PERCENT OF

    If the over-allotment option is exercised in full, we plan to use the
additional estimated $1.395 million for drilling of oil and gas wells.
 
    We plan to drill up to 30 wells with proved undeveloped reserves of 48 Bcfe
with an estimated capital cost of approximately $13.0 million after the
completion of the offering and prior to December 31, 2001. We also plan to spend
additional amounts to test deeper unproved zones in some of these same wells at
additional cost which we estimate to be as much as $1.5 million for the initial
three wells. If these wells are successful, we will likely continue to drill
these deeper wells and incur additional costs. We expect to use internal cash
flows or proceeds from borrowings under our credit facility in addition to the
proceeds from this offering for this purpose. Those funds are expected to meet
our cash requirements for at least 12 months. The actual wells, costs and timing
may vary depending on drilling results, equipment availability, commodity prices
and other factors. However, a number of factors affecting drilling and our plans
may change.
 
    The debt to be repaid is $427,500 to Ken L. Kenworthy, Jr., our president
and principal shareholder. This debt matures in April, 2001 and bears interest
at a rate approximating the prime rate, which rate was 9.5% at November 30,
2000. $227,500 of this amount will be used by Mr. Kenworthy to retire debt
incurred personally to loan funds to the company. Except for the difference in
principal amount, the terms of Mr. Kenworthy's loan to the company were the same
as those applicable to his personal debt. We have obtained the consent of our
bank lender for our secured revolving credit facility for the repayment of this
debt.
 
    We have a secured revolving credit facility which is more fully described in
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations"". After the offering, we expect the credit facility to remain in
place or be replaced with a larger facility on more favorable terms. We expect
to borrow on the credit facility in the future for additional development or
general corporate purposes. This credit facility has a borrowing base that is
based on the lender's periodic evaluation of oil and gas reserves which sets the
maximum amount we may borrow. As of October 31, 2000, the borrowing base was
$7.25 million, all of which was advanced. If our drilling program is successful
and commodity prices remain at current levels, we expect our borrowing base will
increase. If the borrowing base is not increased and cash flow from operations
plus proceeds of this offering are insufficient to complete our drilling plans,
we may seek alternate sources of financing or postpone planned drilling.
 
    Until used as described above, proceeds may be held in money market
instruments, deposits or similar investments or may be applied to temporarily
reduce borrowings under our credit facility."

into account underwriting discounts and commissions and other estimated
offering expenses that we will pay. We intend to use these net proceeds as

                                                                        Percent

   . We intend to use this amount to fund sales, marketing,
     advertising and promotional programs throughout our
     entire product line. If these programs do not require
     the use of the entire $2,400,000, the remaining amount
     will be used for working capital and general corporate
     purposes.
   Expansion of Manufacturing Facilities, Research and New
   Product Development, and Potential Improvements to our
   Patented Technology.....................................  $  500,000   9.07%
   . We intend to use this amount to expand manufacturing
     facilities, for research and new product development,
     and for potential improvements to our patented
     technology. If these programs do not require the use
     of the entire $500,000, the remaining amount will be
     used for working capital and general corporate
     purposes.
   Accrued Expenses and Other Payments.....................  $  405,000   7.35%
   . We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds to pay
     $225,000 to our executive officers for unpaid
     compensation through March 31, 2000 as follows: James
     C. Witham--$118,000, Karen B. Laustsen--$46,000, and
     Gary S. Wolff--$61,000; and will use an additional
     $180,000 for other miscellaneous accrued expenses and
     payments.
   Working Capital and General Corporate Purposes..........  $1,450,000  26.31%
   . Working capital and general corporate purposes consist
     primarily of selling, general and administrative
     expenses. Proceeds from the sale of common stock if
     the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised,
     will also be used for working capital and general
     corporate purposes.
       Total...............................................  $5,512,000 100.00%
   Although we are using part of the net proceeds to pay all executives for
unpaid compensation through March 31, 2000, additional unpaid compensation of
$191,000 through November 30, 2000 and any unpaid compensation after that date
will be paid from the operations of Aquacell in 2001.
   The foregoing represents our best estimate of how we will allocate the net
proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock. This estimate is based upon
the current state of our business operations, our current plans and current
economic and industry conditions, and is subject to reallocation among the
categories listed above or for additional purposes. Accordingly, we will have
broad discretion as to the application of the net proceeds.
   Investors will not be able to direct the use of these funds or have any
opportunity to review the development or marketing of products. We may not use
the net proceeds from this offering in the manner that, in hindsight, would
have been the most productive or efficient manner possible and inefficient
allocation of the proceeds from this offering would adversely affect our
business, results of operations and financial condition.
   We believe that the net proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to meet
our projected needs for working capital and other capital requirements through
at least the 12 months following completion of this offering. Pending such
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in interest
bearing accounts, certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short
term investments, all of which have varying risks of loss."

initial public offering price of $12.00 per share, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses payable by us.
     We expect to use between $10.0 and $20.0 million of the net proceeds of
this offering for capital expenditures, including facilities expansion and
purchases of equipment. We will also use $4.0 million of the proceeds to satisfy
a cancellation fee for the termination of a distribution agreement with Endogen

complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary
technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we may
evaluate potential acquisitions of these businesses, products or technologies.
We have no current plans, agreements or commitments, and are not currently
engaged in any negotiations regarding any such transaction.
     Other than as described above, we have no specific plans for use of the
proceeds of this offering. The principal purposes of this offering are to
increase our working capital, create a public market for our common stock,
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets and increase our
visibility in the biotechnology industry."

 For purposes of these calculations, we have deducted the underwriting discounts 
and commissions as well as estimated offering expenses payable by us of approximately 
$4.9 million. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock 
by the selling stockholder. 
      We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows: 
   •  $383.1  million to repurchase Series A preferred stock from Cisco;  
   •  approximately $119.0  million to repay all of our outstanding indebtedness 
to KPMG LLP, consisting of:  
   —   a note which was incurred in connection with our acquisition of the 
consulting business of the Canadian member firm of KPMG International; and     
   —   all of the outstanding indebtedness pursuant to our subordinated revolving 
line of credit from KPMG LLP; and     
   —   other trade payables due to KPMG LLP incurred in the normal course of
 business; and  
   •  approximately $43.0 million to partially repay our outstanding indebtedness 
under our receivables purchase facility.  
      The note issued to KPMG LLP in connection with the Canadian transaction
 bears an interest rate of 8.5% per annum and is payable upon demand. Our 
revolving line of credit from KPMG LLP bears interest at the prime rate less
 1%, and is payable at the earlier of the completion of this offering and August
 24, 2004. For information about the interest rate and maturity of our receivables 
purchase facility, see “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial 
Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and Capital Resources.”"

from this offering, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of 
our Class A common stock by the selling stockholder if the selling stockholder 
sells any shares pursuant to the over-allotment option. For a more detailed 
discussion of the over-allotment option, please see ""Underwriters -- 
Over-allotment Option."" 

We do not have a specific plan for the net proceeds from this offering to be 
received by us. The principal reason for our offering is to raise funds for 
working capital, capital expenditures, debt service, potential acquisitions, 
joint ventures and investments and other general corporate purposes. Debt 
service may include paying interest on, or principal payments of, the $2.5 
billion of debt we are assuming from Lucent under a credit facility. We will 
not receive any of the proceeds of this debt. The debt we will assume has a 
maturity date of February 21, 2002, which is 364 days from the date Lucent 
initially entered into the credit facility. The debt, upon assumption by us, 
will be secured by substantially all of our assets. For our current expected 
rating of BBB- from Standard & Poor's and Baa3 from Moody's, the interest rate 
under the credit facility will be the applicable LIBOR rate plus 250 basis 
points. In addition, unless we repay $1.5 billion of the debt, the interest 
rates on the borrowings will increase by an additional 25 basis points every 
ninety days. Upon any repayment of $1.5 billion of the debt, the interest rates 
on the borrowings, assuming our credit rating remains the same, would return to 
the applicable LIBOR rate plus 250 basis points. Based on the applicable LIBOR 
rate as of February 22, 2001, our weighted average interest rate over the term 
of the facility would be 8.2%, assuming that the applicable LIBOR rate and our 
credit rating remain the same and that we do not make any repayments of the 
debt over the term of the facility. Our interest expense may be higher or lower 
depending on the timing of repayments of the debt, if any, the then applicable 
LIBOR rate or changes to our credit rating. Please see ""Management's Discussion 
and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and 
Capital Resources"" for a more detailed discussion of the interest rates under, 
and other terms of, the credit facility. In addition, we will use a portion of 
our net proceeds from this offering to pay the approximately $200 million of 
costs, fees and expenses we will incur in connection with our separation from 
Lucent. We have no current agreements or commitments with respect to any 
potential acquisitions, joint ventures or investments. 

Management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds 
of this offering. To the extent we do not use proceeds from this offering for 
one of the purposes outlined above, we anticipate that we will allocate such 
funds to one of the other purposes outlined above. You will not have the 
opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information on which 
we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds. Pending such uses, we intend 
to invest the estimated net proceeds of this offering to be received by us in 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

$22.6 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, 
based on an initial offering price of $7.00 per share and after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including repayment of $264,706 outstanding as of December 31, 2000 
under a term loan, capital expenditures and potential acquisitions of 
complementary businesses, products and technologies. The term loan bears 
interest at prime plus 0.25% per annum and matures in December 2001. 

The amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds of this offering will 
depend on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, the 
amount of cash we generate from operations and competitive and technological 
developments. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of 
the net proceeds from this offering. In addition, we may use a portion of the 
net proceeds for the future development of our products or for acquisitions of

currently have no plans, commitments or agreements with respect to any 
acquisitions or investments. We have not determined the manner in which we will 
allocate the net proceeds with any certainty. Pending these uses, we intend to

research and development facilities and $15 million to expand our sales and 
marketing activities. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to pursue 
strategic relationships and to pursue acquisitions of complementary businesses

N.A. Our interest rate under the Fleet facility is, at our option, the prime 
rate plus 0.625%, or 3.25% above the LIBOR rate. As of April 2, 2001, we had 
$11.1 million outstanding on our LIBOR rate loans at an interest rate of 8.6475% 
and we had $1.0 million outstanding on our revolving loan at an interest rate of 
8.0%. All amounts outstanding under the Fleet facility are required to be pre-
paid upon consummation of this offering. The Fleet facility includes a term loan 
and a revolving loan maturing in June 2002. Proceeds from the Fleet facility 
have been used to fund the development of our restaurants and for working 
capital purposes. 

- $10.3 million to repay all amounts outstanding under our 12.5% Senior 
Subordinated Note due June 29, 2006 dated June 29, 1999 held by Magnetite Asset 
Investors, L.L.C., in the original principal amount of $10.0 million, plus a 
prepayment penalty of $300,000. Amounts borrowed under the Magnetite senior 
subordinated note were used to repay a portion of the then outstanding advances 
under our Fleet credit facility and to meet working capital needs. 

- approximately $800,000 for working capital and $200,000 for other general 
corporate purposes. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the proceeds in investment grade, 
interest-bearing investments."

offering will be approximately $133.8 million after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. These 
amounts assume the sale of all of our common stock offered by this prospectus. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- approximately $85.4 million to repay a portion of our senior term loans; 

- approximately $25.5 million to repay a portion of our senior subordinated 
loan and to pay related prepayment premiums; 

- approximately $6.6 million to make a distribution on the preferred units of 
GEEG Holdings, L.L.C. in an aggregate amount equal to the accrued and unpaid 
dividends on those units; and 

- the balance of approximately $16.3 million for general corporate purposes. 

Of the $6.6 million distribution on the preferred units, $3.0 million will be 
paid to our affiliates. Affiliates of Harvest Partners, Inc. will receive $2.4 
million and members of our management and our directors will receive in the 
aggregate $0.6 million. 

As of March 31, 2001, our outstanding senior term loans bore interest at rates 
ranging from 8.34% to 9.09% per annum and consisted of (1) a $27.7 million term 
A loan maturing in July 2006; (2) a $103.8 million term B loan maturing in July 
2008; and (3) a $13.9 million term C loan maturing in July 2006. Our senior 
subordinated loan has an outstanding principal amount of $67.5 million, matures 
in August 2010 and bears interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum. The amounts 
borrowed under the term A loan, the term B loan and the senior subordinated 
loan financed a portion of the August 2000 recapitalization. We used the term 
C loan to partially fund the acquisition of CFI Holdings, Inc. in October 2000. 

We intend to refinance any remaining balances on our senior term loans after 
the application of the net proceeds of this offering using the proceeds of a 
new loan under an amended and restated senior credit facility. Pending 
application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities.

the selling stockholders upon the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment

simultaneous return of capital to Reuters. This advance would otherwise have 
been payable no later than November 2001. This advance bears interest at an

approximately $140.6 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full, after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and 
offering expenses. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to: 

. increase working capital; 

. create a public market for our common stock; 

. enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, products or technologies; 
and 

. facilitate future access to public equity markets. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering primarily to fund 
operating losses and for working capital and other general corporate purposes,

marketing, to implement our business strategies. We may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds from this offering to acquire or invest in businesses,

research and development efforts, approximately $20.0 to $30.0 million on our 
sales and marketing activities and the balance on working capital and for 
general corporate purposes. The amount we actually spend for any of the 
purposes above will vary significantly depending on a number of factors,

proceeds from this offering, changing business conditions, the amount of cash 
used in our operations, the rate of growth of our business, future revenue 
growth, if any, the amount of cash we generate from operations and the 
availability of appropriate opportunities to acquire complementary businesses

or other purposes as we deem necessary or appropriate. Management will have 
considerable discretion in the application of the net proceeds of this offering.

estimated offering expenses. 

In the master separation agreement, we have agreed that to the extent the net 
proceeds of this offering (including proceeds from the exercise of the 
underwriters' over-allotment option) exceed $1.4 billion, we will use 50% of the 
net proceeds above such amount to repay certain indebtedness we owe Reliant 
Energy aggregating Euro 560 million (approximately $528 million based on the 
December 31, 2000 exchange rate of 1.0616 Euros per U.S. dollar). This 
indebtedness was incurred in the fourth quarter of 1999 in connection with the 
funding of the UNA purchase obligation. This indebtedness bears interest at the 
inter-bank offered rate for Euros (EURIBOR) plus 0.75% per annum. This 
indebtedness is included in the $1.9 billion of our indebtedness owed to Reliant 
Energy that Reliant Energy has agreed to convert to equity as a capital 
contribution prior to the closing of this offering. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering initially to increase our 
working capital. We expect to use these proceeds to fund capital expenditures, 
including the funding of construction costs of, and combustion turbine payments 
relating to, our generating facilities currently under construction. We have 
estimated 2001 capital requirements of $1.0 billion, including capital 
expenditures relating to four generating facilities under construction with 
total remaining estimated costs of construction of $436 million. We also plan 
to continue to expand our portfolio of generation assets through acquisitions 
of generation facilities. Depending on the timing of any of these acquisitions, 
we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to finance one or 
more future acquisitions if the proceeds have not yet been used to finance 
capital expenditures as of the date of such acquisitions. We expect to finance 
future capital expenditures that are not paid for with net proceeds from this

to obtain additional working capital, to create a public market for our common

approximately $5.0 million for debt repayment under our credit facility with 
Transamerica Business Credit Corporation. Borrowings under this credit facility

of March 31, 2001), and matures on May 31, 2001, subject to automatic renewal 
and early termination. Debt incurred under this credit facility was used 
primarily for working capital and general corporate purposes. We expect to use 
approximately $3.0 million for rent and improvements relating to new facilities 
required for expansion. We plan to use the balance of the net proceeds for cash 
reserves to strengthen our balance sheet, and if the need arises, for working 
capital and general corporate purposes. The amounts that we expend for these 
purposes will depend on a number of factors, including, among other things: 

- market acceptance of our new products; 
- the success of our current research and development efforts; 
- future revenue growth; 
- the amount of cash, if any, we generate from operations; 
- marketing and sales activities; and

proceeds of this offering. As a result, our management will have broad 
discretion with respect to their use, and investors will be relying on the

Chesterfield Financial will purchase all of the capital stock of Chesterfield 
Federal to be issued in the conversion in exchange for 50% of the net proceeds 
of the stock offering. Receipt of 50% of the net proceeds will increase 
Chesterfield Federal's capital and will support the expansion of Chesterfield 
Federal's existing business activities. Chesterfield Federal will use these 
funds for general business purposes, including loan originations and investment
in U.S. government and federal agency securities. 

Chesterfield Financial intends to loan the employee stock ownership plan the 
amount necessary to acquire an amount of shares equal to 8% of the shares 
issued in the conversion. The loan to the employee stock ownership plan will be 
$2,213,000 and $2,995,000 at the minimum and maximum of the offering range. 
See ""Management--Benefit Plans--Employee Stock Ownership Plan and Trust."" 

The net proceeds available to Chesterfield Federal will be used for general 
corporate purposes. On a short-term basis, Chesterfield Federal may purchase 
investment and mortgage-backed securities. The net proceeds received by 
Chesterfield Federal will further strengthen Chesterfield Federal's capital 
position, which already exceeds regulatory requirements. After the conversion, 
Chesterfield Federal's tangible capital ratio will be 15.14%, based upon the 
midpoint of the offering range. As a result, Chesterfield Federal will continue
to be a well-capitalized institution. 

Initially, we will use the remaining net proceeds retained by us to invest in 
U.S. Government and federal agency securities of various maturities, deposits 
in either the FHLB of 

Chicago or other financial institutions, to purchase mortgage-backed securities
issued by U.S. Government agencies and government-sponsored enterprises, or a 
combination of these items. Depending on market conditions or business 
opportunities available to us and Chesterfield Federal, the net proceeds may 
ultimately be used to: 

. support Chesterfield Federal's lending activities 

. support the future expansion of operations through the establishment or 
acquisition of branch offices or other customer facilities or financial 
institutions, although no such transactions are specifically being considered 
at this time 

. pay regular or special cash dividends, repurchase common stock or pay returns
of capital 

Applicable conversion regulations require us to sell common stock in the 
conversion in an amount equal to our estimated pro forma market value, as 
determined by an independent appraisal. See ""The Conversion--Stock Pricing and 
Number of Shares to be Issued."" As a result, we may be required to sell more 
shares in the conversion than we may otherwise desire. To the extent we have 
excess capital upon completion of the conversion, we intend to consider stock 
repurchases, dividends and tax-free returns of capital to the extent deemed 
appropriate by our board of directors and permitted by the Office of Thrift 
Supervision. A return of capital is similar to a cash dividend, except for tax 
purposes it is an adjustment to your tax basis rather than income to you. We 
have committed to the Office of Thrift Supervision that we will not take any 
action toward paying a tax-free return of capital during the first year after 
we complete the conversion. 

Our board of directors will also consider stock repurchases after we complete 
the conversion, based upon then existing facts and circumstances, as well as 
applicable statutory and regulatory requirements. The facts and circumstances 
may include but not be limited to the following: 

. market and economic factors such as the price at which the stock is trading 
in the market, the volume of trading, the attractiveness of other investment 
alternatives in terms of the rate of return and risk involved in the investment,
the ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share of the 
remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in our return on equity 

. the avoidance of dilution to stockholders by not having to issue dditional 
shares to cover the exercise of stock options or to fund employee stock benefit
plans 

. any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the best interests 
of Chesterfield Financial and our stockholders 

No stock will be repurchased by us unless Chesterfield Federal continues to 
exceed all applicable regulatory requirements after the repurchases. In 
addition, during the first year following the conversion, the Office of Thrift 
Supervision will only allow us to purchase up to 5% of our common stock and 
only if extraordinary circumstances exist in support of the repurchase. The 
payment of dividends or repurchase of stock will be prohibited if Chesterfield 
Federal's net worth would be reduced below the amount required for the 
liquidation account to be established for the benefit of eligible account 
holders and supplemental eligible account holders. See ""Dividend Policy,"" ""The 
Conversion--Effects of Conversion to Stock Form on Depositors and Borrowers of 
Chesterfield Federal-- Liquidation Rights"" and ""--Restrictions on 
Transferability."" 

Our net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may be more 
or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the number of 
shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change in the 
estimated pro forma market value of Chesterfield Federal. Payments for shares 
made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Chesterfield 
Federal will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by 
Chesterfield Federal but will result in a reduction of Chesterfield Federal's 
interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing 
certificates or other deposit accounts."

the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. We intend to use 
$15 million to $25 million of the net proceeds for research and development, 
$5 million to $15 million to expand our sales and marketing efforts and 
$15 million to $25 million for working capital. We might also use a portion of 
the net proceeds for the acquisition of technologies, businesses or products 
that are complementary to our business, although no such acquisitions are 
planned or being negotiated as of the date of this prospectus, and no portion 
of the net proceeds has been allocated for any specific acquisition. Pending 
such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

stock offered by us at an initial public offering price of $19.00 per share, 
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $111.7 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to retire all of our 
outstanding subordinated and junior subordinated notes, totaling $61.5 million 
(including accrued interest), in each case as of May 5, 2001. As of 
May 5, 2001, Freeman Spogli owned 60% and The Limited owned 40% of our 
outstanding subordinated and junior subordinated notes. The net proceeds from 
this offering will also be used to repay approximately $50.3 million under our 
revolving credit facility. After repaying this amount, there will be 
approximately $151.3 million available under our revolving credit facility to 
fund the growth of our business, subject to the borrowing base limitations 
under that facility. 

The outstanding 10 year subordinated notes were issued on August 31, 1999, with 
an initial principal amount of $25.0 million, and a semi annual pay-in- kind 
coupon of 12.0%. The outstanding 10 year junior subordinated notes were issued 
on August 31, 1999, with an initial principal amount of $25.0 million, and a 
semi annual pay-in-kind coupon of 13.5%. The revolving credit facility is a 
$160.0 million senior secured facility that currently bears interest at our 
election at (1) a base rate of prime plus 1.75%, (2) LIBOR plus 2.50% or (3) 
an intraday borrowing rate of prime plus 1.50% plus an additional fee of 0.5%. 
The percentage added to the prime rate varies from 1.25% to 1.75% and the 
percentage added to the LIBOR rate varies from 2.25% to 2.75%, in each case 
depending on the ratio of our average debt to cash flow. As of May 5, 2001, 
the base rate calculated under the revolving credit facility was 9.0%, the 
adjusted LIBOR (for our 30 day LIBOR loans outstanding on that date) was 
6.8825% and the intraday rate was 9.5%. The revolving credit facility matures 
on May 3, 2004."

million (or $929.1 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to 
purchase additional shares of common stock, as described under ""Underwriters""). 

In addition to the initial public offering the plan of reorganization permits 
us to complete one or more other specified types of capital raising 
transactions on the plan's effective date. These may include one or more of: 

-- an offering of preferred securities; 

-- an offering of mandatorily convertible debt or preferred securities; 

-- an offering of convertible debt or preferred securities; 

-- an offering of debt securities, commercial paper issuances or bank 
borrowings; and 

-- a private placement of common stock or any of the other types of securities 
mentioned above. 

The plan of reorganization provides that our aggregate gross proceeds from any 
permitted capital raising transactions other than the initial public offering 
may not exceed 20% of the sum of such gross proceeds plus the gross proceeds of 
the initial public offering. 

As required by the plan of reorganization, we will use the net proceeds from 
the initial public offering and the other permitted capital raising 
transactions, if any, in the following order of priority: 

-- We will contribute approximately $41.4 million to Phoenix Life to reimburse 
Phoenix Life for its payments of cash and its crediting of policy credits to 
policyholders in the demutualization. 

-- We will contribute to Phoenix Life an amount equal to the amount of the fees 
and expenses incurred by Phoenix Life in connection with the demutualization 
and this offering, including those of advisors engaged by the New York State 
Insurance Department, estimated to be $30.0 million. 

-- We will transfer to Phoenix Life, as consideration for the shares of common 
stock of any subsidiaries, including PXP, that Phoenix Life transfers to us or 
our designated subsidiaries, subject to the approval of the New York 
Superintendent of Insurance, $660.0 million to reflect the fair market value of 
such shares on the effective date of the demutualization. Under the plan of 
reorganization, if Phoenix Life makes any such transfer, it may not transfer 
less than all the shares of common stock of the company in question. 

-- We will contribute to Phoenix Life any remaining net proceeds to be used for 
its general corporate purposes."

access to public capital markets. As of the date of this prospectus, we have 
not allocated the net proceeds of this offering to specific uses. We expect to 
use the net proceeds primarily for general corporate purposes, including

the sale of 5,400,000 shares of common stock at the initial public offering 
price of $11.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and 
commissions of $4,158,000 and estimated offering expenses of approximately 
$2,900,000. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, 
we will receive net proceeds of approximately $60,628,300. 

We plan to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- approximately $24.7 million, plus accrued interest, to repay outstanding 
borrowings under our credit facility with Reservoir Capital Partners, L.P. and 
the other lenders thereunder, under which we had outstanding borrowings of 
approximately $24.7 million as of June 18, 2001, bearing interest at 13% per 
year; 

- approximately $5.0 million to $8.0 million to acquire the operations of our 
remaining domestic franchisees; 

- approximately $4.5 million to repay outstanding borrowings under our credit 
facility with Excel Bank, N.A., under which we had outstanding borrowings of 
$4.5 million as of June 18, 2001, bearing interest at the prime rate plus 1%, 
which was 8% as of June 18, 2001; and 

- the remainder for capital expenditures, working capital and other general 
corporate purposes. 

If we are able to reach agreements to acquire all of our remaining domestic 
franchises, the $5.0 million to $8.0 million allocated for that purpose in the 
previous paragraph would represent approximately 25% of the approximately 
$20.0 million to $30.0 million that we estimate would be required to consummate 
these acquisitions. We will seek to finance the remaining portion of the 
purchase price we expect to pay for these operations through one or more credit 
facilities that we will seek to obtain shortly after completion of this 
offering. If we are unable to obtain debt financing in the amounts we require 
or on acceptable terms, we may use the net proceeds of this offering to pay a 
greater portion of the purchase price of these operations, up to 100% of the 
purchase price. To the extent we do so, this will reduce the amount of the net 
proceeds available for the other uses identified above. We may also seek to 
refinance a portion of our outstanding indebtedness under our line of credit 
with Reservoir Capital Partners, L.P. 

The actual aggregate purchase price that we pay for the businesses operated by 
our franchisees may differ materially from our estimates and will depend upon 
numerous factors, including our ability to negotiate favorable terms with our 
remaining franchisees, the continuing viability of our acquisition strategy and 
the timing of any completed acquisitions. We may also use the net proceeds from 
this offering to acquire or invest in other complementary businesses or 
technologies. 

The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors, 
including the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the timing 
of any acquisitions we complete, the availability of debt financing and the 
amount of cash generated by our operations. Until the proceeds from this 
offering are used as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of 
this offering in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. 

The above description represents our present intentions based on our current 
plans and business conditions. Unforeseen events or changed business conditions,
however, could result in the application of the net proceeds from this offering 
in a manner other than as described in this prospectus. As of the date of this 
prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for the 
net proceeds we will have upon completion of this offering. Accordingly, our 
management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this 
offering. To the extent we do not complete the acquisitions of our remaining 
franchisees, a larger portion of the net proceeds from this offering will not 
be designated for a specific use and will be subject to the broad discretion of 
our management."

rate on the term loan was 7.6% and the effective interest rate on the
outstanding amount of the revolving loan commitment was 9.1%. The term loan
matures in installments through July 25, 2003, and the revolving loan commitment
matures on July 25, 2003.
    Although we are currently considering acquisition candidates in the
transaction services field and we continue to monitor and evaluate acquisition
opportunities on an ongoing basis, we have no present agreements, commitments or
understandings with respect to the acquisition of any business at this time. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures for general corporate purposes will vary
depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated or used
by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of
growth of our business. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering."

The debt we intend to repay includes: 
   
•   a $99,794 note at an interest rate of 10% payable to Phillips Smith, our 
chairman and a stockholder, for unreimbursed business expenses;  
   
•   $300,400 of accrued interest on notes payable to Bruce Culver, a director 
and stockholder, and Phillips Smith, consisting of $268,300 outstanding at 
December 31, 2000 and accrued interest for the period from January 1, 2001 
through March 31, 2001 of approximately $32,100;  
   
•   $611,500 of notes and accrued interest at interest rates ranging from 11% 
to 18%, payable to an unrelated private lender; and  
   
•   a $189,980 note at an interest rate of 10% payable to a third-party vendor.  

Further, if the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full, we will 
repay the principal on other outstanding stockholder notes of approximately $1.3 
million which currently mature in July 2002. 

We intend to use the portion of the net proceeds of this offering allocated to 
sales and marketing programs in the next two years to develop a national and 
international program to educate law enforcement, corrections and government 
agencies about our products. We also intend to dedicate such proceeds in 2002 
and 2003 to the development of a consumer market through activities including 
the addition of a customer service department and the sponsorship of new 
consumer advertising campaigns. 

We may use the portion of the net proceeds of this offering currently allocated 
to other working capital/general corporate purposes to take advantage of early 
payment discounts which may be available from our suppliers, prepay some of our 
capital leases or reduce our current liabilities other than amounts owing to 
related parties. Although we currently have no agreements or commitments to do 
so, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to license or acquire new 
products, technologies or intellectual property or to acquire or invest in 
businesses complimentary to ours. We have no current plans or proposals pending 
for any such acquisitions or investments. Pending application of the net 
proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing, investment 
grade securities. 

The foregoing discussion is merely an estimate based on our current business 
plan. Our actual expenditures may vary depending upon circumstances not yet 
known, such as the time actually required to reach a positive cash flow or to 
successfully expand the market for our products."
TORCH OFFSHORE INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/torch-offshore-inc-82467-11975,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/torch-offshore-inc-82467-11975,424B4,6/7/2001,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=731525,"The net proceeds to us from the offering will be approximately $73 million, or 
$79 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the 
selling stockholders in the over-allotment option. We intend to use the net 
proceeds to us as follows: 

+ approximately $9 million to provide the equity investment necessary to build 
the Midnight Warrior; 

+ approximately $11 million to provide a portion of the interim construction 
financing for the Midnight Warrior; 

+ approximately $34 million to repay indebtedness under a loan with 
Transamerica Equipment Financial Services Corporation and loans with Regions 
Bank; 

+ approximately $10 million to purchase the BH-400; 

+ approximately $3 million for construction of a reel base shore facility and 
miscellaneous equipment upgrades; and 

+ any balance for general corporate purposes. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities or government obligations. 

The Transamerica loan matures in August 2005 and bears interest at a fixed rate 
of 10.56% per year. At April 30, 2001, approximately $25.8 million was 
outstanding under the Transamerica loan. In addition, we will pay a prepayment 
penalty of approximately $0.8 million to Transamerica in connection with the 
repayment of the loan. We have an $8.0 million revolving line of credit and an 
equipment loan with Regions Bank. The revolving line of credit matures in 
November 2001 and bears interest at a variable annual rate equal to 3.0% plus 
the 30-day LIBOR rate. The equipment loan matures in August 2002 and bears 
interest at a fixed rate of 8.5% per year. At April 30, 2001, approximately 
$6.1 million was outstanding under the revolving line of credit and 
approximately $1.2 million was outstanding under the equipment loan. 

The amount required to build the Midnight Warrior will be approximately 
$70 million, including MARAD's guarantee fee and interest costs incurred during 
construction. We have a written commitment from MARAD to provide a government 
guarantee supporting the long-term financing of up to 87.5% of the cost of the 
Midnight Warrior when it is delivered. The balance of the funding requirements 
are represented by the approximately $9 million in equity we will provide from 
the proceeds of the offering. We expect the interest rate on this long-term 
financing will be comparable to United States agency financing at the time. We 
expect that we will be required to provide approximately $11 million of interim 
construction financing for the Midnight Warrior, with additional interim 
construction funds of approximately $50 million to be provided by commercial 
lenders pending completion of the vessel and long-term financing. We are 
currently in discussions with lenders to provide this interim construction 
financing for the vessel. MARAD has the option to terminate the commitment if 
we have not placed a portion of the permanent long-term financing, as 
authorized by MARAD, by November 6, 2001. The commitment is also subject to 
customary conditions. In the past, MARAD has not terminated commitments where 
the applicant was making demonstrable progress towards a closing. We cannot 
assure you that we will be able to demonstrate sufficient progress or that 
MARAD will continue to honor the commitment beyond November 6, 2001."

based upon the sale of 6,700,000 shares of common stock at the initial public 
offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be 
approximately $113.2 million. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering: 

. to repay approximately $54.3 million principal amount of our 12.75% senior 
subordinated notes due 2009 at a redemption price of $61.2 million; 

. to repay approximately $34.5 million under our $185 million credit facility; 
and 

. to pay $2.5 million to Kelso & Company in consideration for the termination 
of annual fees for financial advisory services provided to us. 

If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, we expect to use the 
net proceeds to repay additional borrowings under our credit facility. 

Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds of the offering in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities. 

The amount of our $185 million credit facility that will be repaid consists of 
$10.5 million of Term A loans payable in full by November 2005 and 
$24.0 million of Term B loans payable in full by November 2006. The Term A 
loans currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 2.875% and the Term B Loans 
currently bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.875%."
