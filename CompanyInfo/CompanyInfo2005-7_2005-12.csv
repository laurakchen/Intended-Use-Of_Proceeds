estimated to be approximately $37.9 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from our sale of shares in this offering,
together with cash provided by operations and, if necessary, funds available
under our credit facility, to continue to open new retail stores across the
country and for general corporate purposes, and we will use approximately
$19.6 million of our net proceeds to pay our preferred shareholders all of the
accrued and unpaid dividends due upon conversion of their shares of preferred
stock into shares of our common stock. During fiscal 2005, we opened ten new
stores and we expect to open a total of 28 to 32 stores in fiscal 2006 and
fiscal 2007, of which eleven have already been opened. In fiscal 2006, we expect
our capital expenditures to be approximately $14.0 million, substantially all of
which will relate to planned store openings in fiscal 2006 and the first quarter
of fiscal 2007. Our preferred shareholders have agreed to convert their shares
of our preferred stock into shares of our common stock simultaneously with the
closing of this offering. All accrued and unpaid dividends on our preferred 
stock will be paid in connection with this offering.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our current plans and
business condition. Management will have broad discretion in the application of
our net proceeds from this offering, and the occurrence of unforeseen events or
changes in business conditions could result in the application of our net
proceeds from this offering in a manner other than as described in this
prospectus. From time to time, we evaluate potential acquisitions of
complementary businesses, products and technologies. Should we determine to
employ cash resources for acquisitions, the amounts available for the purposes
described above may be significantly reduced. At this time, we have no specific
agreements, understandings, commitments or arrangements with respect to any
acquisition. Pending application of our net proceeds, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities.

Selling shareholders have agreed to sell 950,000 shares of common stock (and, up
to an additional 592,500 shares if the underwriters' overallotment option is
exercised). We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by the selling shareholders."

(1) Consists of an underwriting discount of 6% of the gross proceeds of this
    Offering (including any units sold to cover overallotments).
(2) Upon consummation of a business combination, Maxim Group LLC will be paid
    an additional underwriting discount in the amount of 1% of the gross
    proceeds of this Offering (including any units sold to cover
    overallotments) out of the funds held in trust.
(3) The 1% non-accountable expense allowance is not payable with respect to the
    units sold upon exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment option.

   $64,980,000, or $74,932,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of the net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JP
Morgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the
trust fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of
directors at that time.

   We have agreed to pay Equity Dynamics, Inc., an affiliated third party of
which Mr. Pappajohn is the President and principal stockholder, and Mr. Kinley
a Senior Vice President, approximately $6,000 per month for office space and
certain additional general and administrative services. We have also agreed to
pay another affiliated third party, The Lan Group, of which Dr. Schaffer is the
sole owner, approximately $1,500 per month for office space and certain
additional general and administrative services.

   John Pappajohn, our chairman and secretary, or his designees, has agreed to
purchase up to $1,000,000 of our warrants in the open market, at a price per
warrant not to exceed $1.20, within three months of such warrants being
separately tradeable. These warrants will not be sold by Mr. Pappajohn or his
designees until the consummation of a business combination. Maxim Group LLC
has also agreed to purchase up to $500,000 of our warrants in the open market
on similar terms; however, Maxim Group LLC may sell their warrants prior to
the consummation of a business combination.

   Prior to the closing of a business combination, we have agreed to obtain
keyman life insurance in the amount of $3,000,000 in the aggregate on the
lives of certain members of our management for a three year period. Based on
current estimates, the premium for such life insurance policies, of which we
will be the sole beneficiary, is expected to be approximately $5,000 per year.

   We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $450,000) being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses
will be performed by some or all of our officers and directors and may include
engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers
and directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of
prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities. We believe that the excess working capital will be
sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

   It is also possible that we could use a portion of such excess working
capital to make a deposit, down payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required
to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement
relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of
working capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due
diligence and pay other expenses related to finding another suitable business
combination without securing additional financing. Thus, if we were unable to
secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a
business combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

   To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

   As of the date of this prospectus,Mr. Pappajohn, Dr. Schaffer and Mr. Kinley
have loaned us a total of $250,000 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering, such as SEC registration fees, NASD registration
fees, AMEX listing fees and legal and accounting fees and expenses. These loans
will be payable without interest on the earlier of April 28, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the net proceeds
of this offering not being placed in trust.

   The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed. We believe that, upon consummation of this offering,
we will have sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24
months, assuming that a business combination is not consummated during that
time.

   Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month general and administrative service
fees described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder's and
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with
the consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations.
After the consummation of a business combination, if any, to the extent our
management remains as officers of the resulting business, we anticipate that
they may enter into employment agreements, the terms of which shall be
negotiated and which we expect to be comparable to employment agreements with
other similarly-situated companies in the healthcare industry. Further, after
the consummation of a business combination, if any, to the extent our
directors remain as directors of the resulting business, we anticipate that
they will receive compensation comparable to directors at other similarly-
situated companies in the healthcare industry.

   A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only
in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares
into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust fund. The term public stockholders means the holders of
common stock sold as part of the units in this offering or in the open market,
including any existing stockholders to the extent that they purchase or
acquire such shares."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. We will not receive any of the net proceeds from any sale of shares of
common stock by any selling stockholders.

    We will use our net proceeds from this offering:
   •  to repay $30.1 million of outstanding indebtedness under our existing bank

of the underwriter’s over-allotment option for general corporate purposes.
    The term portion of our existing credit facility bears interest at a
weighted average annual interest rate of 3.6% and matures in January 2010. The
revolving portion of our existing credit facility bears interest at a weighted
average annual interest rate of 3.4% and matures in January 2011. We used the
borrowings under this facility to purchase additional equipment in 2004. We have
an additional line of credit that bears interest at a weighted average annual
interest rate of 3.7% and is payable on demand. Following the closing of this
offering, we intend to terminate our existing credit facility and line of credit
and enter into a new revolving credit facility. 

    In connection with the closing of the contribution agreement, and prior to
the closing of this offering, we will incur an additional $7.2 million of

in “Related Party Agreements” and the balance of the net proceeds to ratably
repay a portion of the outstanding borrowings under the Tranche B term loan and
Tranche C term loan that form part of our senior credit facility. We estimate
that we will repay approximately $77.7 million and $44.3 million of principal
under the Tranche B term loan and the Tranche C term loan, respectively. As of
March 31, 2005, we had outstanding indebtedness of approximately $260.0 million
under the Tranche B term loan and $148.0 million under the Tranche C term loan.
The borrowings under the Tranche B term loan mature on July 1, 2012 and the
borrowings under the Tranche C term loan mature on December 10, 2012. The
borrowings under both Tranche B and C currently bear interest at LIBOR plus
2.25% per annum (5.37% as of March 31, 2005). The borrowings under the Tranche B
term loan were used to finance our acquisition of Red Simpson, to refinance our
then-existing indebtedness, to pre-fund some of our deferred compensation

that are complementary to our business. Although we have from time to time
evaluated possible acquisitions, we currently have no commitments or agreements

acquisitions in the future. Until we use our net proceeds of the offering, we

scheduled to mature on April 14, 2010, and the term loan C facility is scheduled
to mature on October 14, 2011. Our senior notes bear interest at a rate of 93/4%
annually and are scheduled to mature on April 1, 2012. The proceeds from our
borrowings under the term loan A facility, the term loan B facility and our
issuance of the senior notes were used, together with other sources of funds, to
pay a portion of the purchase price of the TXUCV acquisition and to repay
existing debt of Consolidated Communications, Inc., which we refer to as CCI,
among other uses of funds. On October 22, 2004, we converted all borrowings then
outstanding under the term loan B facility into approximately $314.0 million of

we do not have any understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any
such acquisitions or investments.

the particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. Accordingly, our

    We assume that we will use approximately $858,000 to repay certain bridge
loans, which bear interest at 8% per annum and are repayable at closing of this
offering.

    We intend to spend approximately $300,000 to bring current our accounts
payable.

    We intend to spend approximately $500,000 on administrative expenses,
including rent and office overhead. Approximately $90,000 will be used to pay
deferred compensation amounts to officers or directors as provided in their
employment agreements for amounts that they agreed would be deferred from 2004
and 2005.

    We intend to spend approximately $1,300,000 on sales and marketing related
activities, including salaries, travel, demonstration units and promotions.

    We intend to spend approximately $800,000 on inventory purchases.

    We intend to spend approximately $200,000 on capital expenditures.

    We intend to spend approximately $325,000 on product development.

    We intend to use the balance of the proceeds of this offering, estimated at
approximately $1,753,000, (approximately $2,078,400 if the underwriter’s
over-allotment is exercised in full) as well as cash generated from operations,
for working capital and for general corporate purposes, including non-sales,
non-marketing and non-development related personnel costs; the additional costs
of being a public company including audit fees, legal fees and compliance with
the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002; and general office overhead and expenses such as
rent, telecommunications, and internal IT costs.

    Actual expenditures may vary substantially from these estimates. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including the status of our product development efforts, marketing and sales
activities, and the amount of cash generated by our operations. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other purposes.

    Circumstances that may give rise to a change in the use of proceeds include
opportunities or the need to take advantage of additional marketing activities,
increased costs of doing business over those currently expected, the need to
accelerate, increase or eliminate the release of product enhancements due to
changing market conditions, and/or the need for us to spend additional sums on
intellectual property and patent protection. Pending any of these uses, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term,
interest-bearing, investment grade securities. We anticipate that the proceeds
will be sufficient for our operations for the next 12 months.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the results of our sales and marketing activities,
technological advances, competition and the amount of cash generated or used by
our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds
for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the
balance of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in certificates of deposit, short-term obligations of
the United States government, or other money-market instruments that are rated
investment grade or its equivalent."
ORCHIDS PAPER PRODUCTS CO /DE,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/orchids-paper-products-co-de-671093-44166,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/orchids-paper-products-co-de-671093-44166,424B4,7/18/2005,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3794620,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common
stock we are offering will be approximately $13.0 million. If the underwriter
fully exercises the over-allotment option, the net proceeds will be
approximately $15.1 million. “Net proceeds” are what we expect to receive after
we pay the underwriting discount and other estimated expenses for this offering.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to expand our production
capacity in order to lower our production costs and to create a public market
for our common stock.

    We plan to use the proceeds from the sale of stock, borrowings under a
proposed credit agreement and, if necessary, use of our existing cash and cash
flows from operations to purchase and install a new paper machine. The project
consists of purchasing a paper machine, constructing a building to house the
machine and the auxiliary equipment and increasing the capacity of the existing
de-inking plant. The cost breakdown for the project is approximately 40% for the
paper machine and 60% for the building, auxiliary equipment, de-inking equipment
and engineering. The paper machine will be a new, modern crescent former with an
18 foot yankee dryer and a reel trim width of 102” with a gas-fired hood. This
machine will be constructed in Europe, dismantled, shipped to Oklahoma and
re-assembled. A new steel building will be erected next to our existing paper
mill. This building will house the new paper machine and its auxiliary
equipment, including storage tanks, piping and vacuum systems, as well as enough
storage for approximately three days of parent roll production.

    The total expenditure for the project is estimated to be $27.0 million.
While we expect to incur project costs over a period of 18 months, we have not
yet determined the timing of the expenditures for the new paper machine.
Further, these expenditures may vary significantly depending on a variety of
factors, including the timing of construction and delivery of the paper machine.

    We intend to use substantially all of the net proceeds from this offering to
finance this project. We expect to finance the estimated $12.4 million of
remaining project expenditures through borrowings under a term loan agreement
and, if necessary, use of our existing cash and cash flows from operations. 

    Pending our use of the proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds of
this offering primarily in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing
instruments."
BIRD ACQUISITION CORP.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/bird-acquisition-corp-672643-44418,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/bird-acquisition-corp-672643-44418,424B1,7/18/2005,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3794601,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale by us of the shares of
common stock being offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $177.8 million, based on the
initial public offering price per share of $11.50.

    We intend to use approximately:
   •  $163.0 million of the net proceeds to repay all $161.1 million principal    
      amount, plus accrued interest, expected to be outstanding immediately prior 
      to the closing of this offering under our term loan facility, which was used
      to finance or refinance the purchase of our first five vessels; and         
  
   •  $14.8 million of the net proceeds to fund a portion of the purchase price of
      the remaining three vessels in our initial fleet.                           

    We also intend to use the net proceeds we receive from any shares sold
pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option to fund a portion of the
purchase price of the undelivered vessels in our initial fleet or repay
indebtedness incurred for that purpose.

    We currently expect that we will use a portion of such net proceeds to repay
all $161.1 million principal amount, plus accrued interest, expected to be
outstanding under our term loan facility immediately prior to the closing of
this offering. The term loan facility currently accrues interest at LIBOR plus
1.565% per annum with respect to Tranche A and LIBOR plus 2.75% per annum with
respect to Tranche B, and is due to mature on July 29, 2011, with quarterly
amortization prior thereto. Borrowings under the term loan facility were used to
repay in full all amounts outstanding under a $150 million bridge loan credit
agreement that were incurred to finance a portion of the purchase price of the
first five vessels in our initial fleet. Following the offering, we expect to
either draw down an additional $95.7 million under our term loan facility to
finance the balance of the purchase price of the remaining three vessels in our
initial fleet, or alternatively, if we obtain the proposed revolving credit
facility, to draw down all or a portion of such funds under the proposed
revolving credit facility to purchase such vessels or refinance amounts drawn
under the term loan facility to purchase such vessels and thereupon terminate
the term loan facility."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
    from Messrs. McMillen, Weiss and Mitchell described below. These funds will  
    be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon
    consummation of this offering.                                               
 
$37,660,000, or $43,309,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
dissolution and liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of
directors at that time.
 
We currently pay an unaffiliated third party approximately $190 per month for
office space and certain other additional administrative services. Upon
completion of the initial public offering, we have allocated up to a maximum of
$7,500 per month for office space and general administrative services to be paid
to Global Defense Corporation, an affiliate of Mr. McMillen. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Global Defense Corporation for our benefit and is not
intended to provide Mr. McMillen compensation in lieu of salary. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the Washington D.C. metropolitan
area, that the fee charged by Global Defense Corporation is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. However, as our
directors may not be deemed independent, we did not have the benefit of
disinterested directors approving these transactions. Upon completion of a
business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay
this monthly fee.
 
We intend to use the excess working capital for director and officer liability
insurance premiums and due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations if our estimates are exceeded,
as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our
existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described
below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.
 
However, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in the
trust account to make a deposit, down payment or fund a no-shop provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating
to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working
capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay
other expenses related to finding a suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. If were unable to secure additional financing, we
would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time
and would be forced to liquidate.
 
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.
 
Washington Capital Advisors, LLC., a company owned by our Chairman and a member
of our Board of Directors, C. Thomas McMillen, Harvey Weiss, our Chief Executive
Officer, President, Secretary and a member of our Board of Directors, and David
Mitchell, a member of our Board of Directors, advanced to us $25,000, $25,000
and $10,000, respectively, aggregating $60,000, which was used to pay a portion
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans
will be payable without interest on the earlier of March 9, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.
 
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
government securities, defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States
having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.
 
Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation of any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any affiliates of our directors or
officers, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our dissolution and liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received 
    from Messrs. McMillen, Weiss and Mitchell described below. These funds will  
    be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon
    consummation of this offering.                                               
 
$37,660,000, or $43,309,000 if the underwriters over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. The proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust
fund until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
dissolution and liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust fund may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business may be used to finance operations of the target
business or to effect other acquisitions, as determined by our board of
directors at that time.
 
We currently pay an unaffiliated third party approximately $190 per month for
office space and certain other additional administrative services. Upon
completion of the initial public offering, we have allocated up to a maximum of
$7,500 per month for office space and general administrative services to be paid
to Global Defense Corporation, an affiliate of Mr. McMillen. This arrangement is
being agreed to by Global Defense Corporation for our benefit and is not
intended to provide Mr. McMillen compensation in lieu of salary. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the Washington D.C. metropolitan
area, that the fee charged by Global Defense Corporation is at least as
favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. However, as our
directors may not be deemed independent, we did not have the benefit of
disinterested directors approving these transactions. Upon completion of a
business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay
this monthly fee.
 
We intend to use the excess working capital for director and officer liability
insurance premiums and due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of
structuring and negotiating business combinations if our estimates are exceeded,
as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our
existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described
below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover
the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.
 
However, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in the
trust account to make a deposit, down payment or fund a no-shop provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to
forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating
to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working
capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay
other expenses related to finding a suitable business combination without
securing additional financing. If were unable to secure additional financing, we
would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time
and would be forced to liquidate.
 
To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.
 
Washington Capital Advisors, LLC., a company owned by our Chairman and a member
of our Board of Directors, C. Thomas McMillen, Harvey Weiss, our Chief Executive
Officer, President, Secretary and a member of our Board of Directors, and David
Mitchell, a member of our Board of Directors, advanced to us $25,000, $25,000
and $10,000, respectively, aggregating $60,000, which was used to pay a portion
of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The loans
will be payable without interest on the earlier of March 9, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.
 
The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
government securities, defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States
having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.
 
We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.
 
Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation of any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our existing stockholders, or any affiliates of our directors or
officers, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.
 
A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our dissolution and liquidation upon our failure to complete a
business combination within the allotted time or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we actually
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund."

proceeds from this offering, or $41.2 million if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, based upon the initial public
offering price of $11.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering costs payable by us.

We expect to use our net proceeds from this offering as follows:

      •     approximately $11 million to continue the product development of our   
            cryoablation system, including our Quantum catheter, and to complete   
            our ongoing clinical trials;                                           

      •     approximately $5 million to build sales and marketing capabilities for 
            our cryoablation system, the majority of which will be used for this   
            purpose following FDA approval of our cryoablation system for the      
            treatment of AFL, if we receive such approval;                         

      •     approximately $1 million for the prosecution and maintenance of our    
            intellectual property portfolio;                                       

      •     approximately $1 million for the production of consoles to be placed in
            medical centers;                                                       

      •     approximately $4 million for the costs of our facility, manufacturing  
            and quality system operations; and                                     

      •    the balance for working capital and other general corporate purposes.
 
The amounts we actually expend in these areas may vary significantly from our
expectations and will depend on a number of factors, including operating costs,
capital expenditures and any expenses related to defending claims of
intellectual property infringement. Accordingly, management will retain broad
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this offering. A portion of
the net proceeds may also be used to acquire or invest in complementary
businesses, technologies, services or products. We have no current plans,
agreements or commitments with respect to any such acquisition or investment,
and we are not currently engaged in any negotiations with respect to any such
transaction.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and
cash equivalent balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash
requirements into the second half of 2006. Pending such uses, the net proceeds
of this offering will be invested in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities."

    (1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we        
          received from our directors described below. These funds will be repaid   
          out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon       
          consummation of this offering.                                            

$31,200,000, or $36,168,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination.

The payment to A.F. Services Ltd., an affiliate of Israel Frieder, our chairman
of the board and chief executive officer, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by A.F. Services Ltd.
for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Frieder compensation in lieu
of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in Israel,
that the fee charged by A.F. Services Ltd. is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders,
we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

$1,010,000 of the net proceeds, regardless of whether the underwriter’s
over-allotment option is exercised in full, will not be placed in trust and will
be available for our use. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $590,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $120,000), with the balance of $470,000 being held in reserve in
the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and
negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the
foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could also use a portion of the
funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although
we do not have any current intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would
be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined
based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our
available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result
of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to
continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential
target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

Our directors have advanced to us a total of $70,000 which was used to pay a
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for
SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The
loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of May 28, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The
interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period
will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs
relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus through the consummation of the
acquisition of the target business, we will pay A.F. Services Ltd. the fee
described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, including our officers and
directors, or any of their affiliates, prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders and
their affiliates will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable
business combinations. Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our
existing stockholders) were to seek to convert such shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances will a public
stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

issued and sold by us in this offering will be approximately $196.5 million, or
approximately $226.8 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering
expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares
of our common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay a portion
of the outstanding indebtedness under our $250 million repurchase agreement with
Banc of America Securities LLC and affiliates. As of June 30, 2005, $231.1
million was outstanding under this repurchase agreement at a weighted average
borrowing rate of 3.90%. Our $250 million repurchase agreement matures on the
earlier of December 31, 2005 or the completion of a collateralized debt
obligation of a majority of the assets financed under the facility. We used the
proceeds from our borrowings under this repurchase agreement to acquire CMBS in
five new issue conduit securitization trusts and three mezzanine loans after the
proceeds from the private placement were fully invested. The borrowings under
this repurchase agreement are secured by certain of our investments. We expect
to borrow additional amounts under our repurchase agreement primarily to finance
additional investments."

$43,140,000, or $49,836,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Comerica
Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until
the earlier of the completion of a business combination and our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to Quantum Value Management, LLC, an affiliate of Messrs.
Skandalaris, Azar, Langevin and Flynn, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain
administrative, technology and secretarial services, as well as the use of
certain limited office space, including a conference room, in Bloomfield Hills,
Michigan. This arrangement is being agreed to by Quantum Value Management, LLC
for our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Skandalaris, Azar,
Langevin and Flynn compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents
and fees for similar services in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan, that the fee
charged by Quantum Value Management, LLC is at least as favorable as we could 
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business 
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this 
monthly fee.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $280,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $40,000), with
the balance of $240,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our initial stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs. We could also use the proceeds of this offering not held in trust to fund
a down payment or lock-up payment with respect to a proposed business
combination, although we do not have any intention to do so. Depending on the
size of such payment and the amount of funds already expended for due diligence
and related expenses, our forfeiture of such payment, whether as a result of our
breach or otherwise, would likely result in our not having sufficient funds to
continue searching for or conducting due diligence with respect to a target
business, or conducting similar operations. Without additional financing after
such an event, we could be unable to complete a business combination.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business. 

Robert J. Skandalaris, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer,
and Michael C. Azar, our president, have advanced to us a total of $75,000 which
was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the
line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees
and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of April
15, 2006 and the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Quantum Value Management,
LLC the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative
fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will
be paid to any of our initial stockholders, our officers or directors, or any of
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, they will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

Ottawa Savings Bancorp, Inc. intends initially to invest the proceeds it retains
from the offering in short-term, liquid investments. Over time, Ottawa Savings
Bancorp, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

    •    to invest in securities;

    •    to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other    
         businesses that are related to banking;                                   

    •    to repurchase shares of our common stock, subject to regulatory           
         restrictions;                                                             
 
    •   to pay dividends to stockholders; and

    •   for general corporate purposes.

Our return on equity will likely be lower in the future because the net proceeds
from the reorganization will significantly increase our equity capital before we
can fully utilize the new capital in our business operations to increase net
income. Consequently, you should not expect a competitive return on equity in
the near future.

Under current OTS regulations, we may not repurchase shares of our common stock
during the first year following the offering, except to fund stock-based benefit
plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when extraordinary circumstances
exist.

Ottawa Savings Bank may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering,
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Ottawa Savings
Bank:

  •   to fund new loans;

  •   to invest in securities;

  •   to finance the possible expansion of its business activities, including   
      developing new branch locations; and                                      

  •   for general corporate purposes

The minimum percentage of net proceeds contributed to Ottawa Savings Bank will
be at least 50% of the net offering proceeds at each level of the offering
range.

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed
above. We currently have no specific plans or agreements regarding any expansion
activities or acquisitions.

Except as described above, neither Ottawa Savings Bancorp, Inc. nor Ottawa
Savings Bank has any specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this
offering."

The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the offering may be
more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase if a
syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts will not result
in the receipt of new funds for investment but will result in a reduction of
United Bank’s deposits. In all instances, United Bank will receive at least 50%
of the net proceeds of the offering.

We are undertaking the offering at this time in order to increase our capital
and have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our business.
The offering proceeds will increase our capital resources and the amount of 
funds available to us for lending and investment purposes. The proceeds will 
also give us greater flexibility to diversify operations and expand the 
products and services we offer to our customers.

United Financial Bancorp, Inc. may use the proceeds it retains from the
offering:

    •   to finance the purchase of common stock in the offering by United Bank’s  
        employee stock ownership plan;                                            
  
    •   to invest in securities;

    •   to deposit funds in United Bank;
  
    •   to repurchase its shares of common stock;

    •   to pay dividends to our stockholders;

    •   to finance acquisitions of financial institutions or branches and other   
        financial services businesses, although no material transactions are being
        considered at this time; and                                              

    •   for general corporate purposes.

Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase
shares of our common stock during the first year following the offering, except
when extraordinary circumstances exist and with prior regulatory approval. The
loans that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stock ownership
plan will accrue interest.

United Bank may use the proceeds it receives from the offering:

  •   to fund new loans;

  •   to support new products and services;

  •   to invest in securities;

  •   to expand its retail banking franchise by establishing de novo branches,  
      by acquiring existing branches, or by acquiring other financial           
      institutions or other financial services companies, although no material  
      acquisitions are specifically being considered at this time; and          

  •   for general corporate purposes.

The use of the proceeds outlined above may change, based on changes in interest
rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial services
industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions to expand our operations, and overall
market conditions. We expect our return on equity to decrease as compared to our
performance in recent years until we are able to utilize effectively the
additional capital raised in the offering. Until we can increase our net
interest income and non-interest income, we expect our return on equity to be
below the industry average, which may negatively affect the value of our common
stock."
FOCUS MEDIA HOLDING LTD,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/focus-media-holding-ltd-676890-45045,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/focus-media-holding-ltd-676890-45045,424B4,7/13/2005,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3788386,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of
approximately $93.3 million, or approximately $103.8 million if the underwriters
exercise their option in full to purchase additional ADSs, after deducting
underwriting discounts and the estimated offering expenses payable by us. These
estimates are based on an assumed initial offering price of $15 per ADS (the
mid-point of the range shown on the front cover page of this prospectus). We
will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders.

    As of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated any specific
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for any particular purpose
discussed below. We anticipate using approximately $20 million of the net
proceeds of this offering in 2005 and approximately $20 million in 2006 for
capital expenditures in connection with the expansion of our advertising network
and operations, of which approximately $14 million will be used in 2005 for the
expansion and operation of our in-store network. We expect to use the balance
for general corporate purposes, including incremental costs associated with
being a public company, and for acquisitions or investments in certain of our
regional distributors, other businesses, products or technologies that we
believe are complementary to our own business or that otherwise extend our
business or brand. If and when we qualify for direct ownership of Focus Media
Advertisement, as discussed more fully in “Corporate Structure — Our Corporate
Structure and Contractual Arrangements”, we may explore the possibility of using
a portion of the proceeds of this offering to acquire Focus Media Advertisement,
taking into consideration relevant cost, market, competitive and other factors.

   We do not currently have any agreements or understandings to make any material
acquisitions of, or investments in, other businesses.

    The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use of
the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and business
conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and discretion
in applying the net proceeds of the offering. The occurrence of new business
opportunities, unforeseen events or changed business conditions may result in
application of the proceeds of this offering in a manner other than as described
in this prospectus.

    To the extent that the net proceeds we receive from this offering are not
immediately applied for the above purposes, we intend to invest our net proceeds
in short-term, interest bearing, debt instruments or bank deposits. These
investments may have a material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax
consequences of your investment in our ADSs. It is possible that we may become a
passive foreign investment company for United States federal income tax
purposes, which could result in negative tax consequences for you. These
consequences are described in more detail in “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to
Our Business and Industry — We may become a passive foreign investment company,
or PFIC, which could result in adverse U.S. tax consequences to U.S. investors”
and “Taxation — United States Federal Income Taxation — Passive Foreign
Investment Companies”.

    In utilizing the proceeds of this offering in the manner described above, as
an offshore holding company of our PRC operating subsidiaries and affiliates, we
may make loans to our PRC subsidiaries and consolidated PRC affiliated entities,
or we may make additional capital contributions to our PRC subsidiaries. Any
loans to our PRC subsidiaries or consolidated PRC affiliated entities are
subject to PRC regulations and approvals. For example:

    •  loans by us to Focus Media Technology or Focus Media Digital through Focus  
       Media Technology, each a foreign invested enterprise, to finance its        
       activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be registered with the   
       State Administration of Foreign Exchange or its local counterpart; and      

    •  loans by us to Focus Media Advertisement or its subsidiaries, which are     
       domestic PRC enterprises, must be approved by the relevant government       
       authority and must also be registered with the State Administration of      
       Foreign Exchange or its local counterpart.                                  

    We may also determine to finance Focus Media Technology or Focus Media
Digital through Focus Media Technology by means of capital contributions. These
capital contributions must be approved by the PRC Ministry of Commerce or its
local counterpart. Because Focus Media Advertisement and its subsidiaries are
domestic PRC enterprises, we are not likely to finance their activities by means
of capital contributions due to regulatory issues relating to foreign investment
in domestic PRC enterprises, as well as the licensing and other regulatory
issues discussed in “Regulation of Our Industry” included elsewhere in this
prospectus. We cannot assure you that we can obtain these government
registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all, with respect to future
loans or capital contributions by us to Focus Media Technology, Focus Media
Digital, Focus Media Advertisement or any of its subsidiaries."

(1)               A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the
                  funds we received from Mr. Goldstein described below. These
                  funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
                  being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

$63,720,000, or $73,764,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Smith
Barney, a division of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds
will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion
of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust
account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business
with which we complete a business combination.

The payment to Alpine Capital LLC, an affiliate of Richard D. Goldstein, our
chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Bruce M. Greenwald, our
president and a member of our board of directors, Gregg H. Mayer, our vice
president and controller, and Oded Aboodi, our special advisor, of a monthly fee
of $7,500 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Alpine
Capital for our benefit and is not intended to provide Messrs. Goldstein,
Greenwald, Mayer and Aboodi compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York City metropolitan
area, that the fee charged by Alpine Capital is at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders,
this arrangement will terminate and we will no longer be required to pay this
monthly fee to Alpine Capital nor will Alpine Capital be required to provide us
with general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $1,915,000. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $1,095,000) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $110,000), with the balance of
$985,000 being held in reserve for tax payments and in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs. We could also use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a
down payment or fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a particular proposed
business combination, although we do not have any current intention to do so. If
we did, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop""
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business
combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of
such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our
not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due
diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

Richard D. Goldstein has advanced to us a total of $100,000 which was used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal and audit fees
and other expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of
April 7, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out
of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not required
for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from
investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our
general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Alpine Capital the fee
described above. Additionally, we will hold the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in the trust fund in an account at Alpine Capital Bank, an
affiliate of Alpine Capital. Alpine Capital Bank will be entitled to charge us
customary fees for banking transactions. Other than the $7,500 per month
administrative fee and any customary banking charges from Alpine Capital Bank,
no compensation of any kind (including finders, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, special advisor,
or stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of 
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no 
ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons 
after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were to seek to
convert such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which
the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

(1)  Excludes the payment of $100 from Wedbush Morgan Securities Inc. for its      
     purchase option, proceeds from the sale of units under the purchase option and
     proceeds from exercise of any warrants.                                       
    
(2)  A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received  
     from Messrs. Balter and Slasky, as described below. These funds will be repaid
     out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account    
     upon consummation of this offering.                                           
    
(3)  Excludes fees and expense allowances payable to the underwriters upon a       
     consummation of a business combination.                                                                    
    
(4)  Miscellaneous expenses includes the reimbursement of our existing stockholders
     for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the offering.          

   We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire one or
more operating businesses in the technology, media or telecommunications
industries.

    Of the net proceeds, $50,380,000, or $58,156,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a
trust account at Smith Barney, Citigroup Global Markets Inc., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. The proceeds will
not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we ultimately complete a business combination. Additionally, the proceeds held
in the trust account may be used to pay the underwriters an additional fee equal
to 2% of the gross proceeds of this offering and to Wedbush Morgan Securities
Inc. an expense allowance equal to 1% of the gross proceeds 
of this offering (excluding the proceeds from any exercise of the
over-allotment option), in each case upon the consummation of our initial
business combination. We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust account in
connection with a business combination, either because the consideration for the
business combination is less than the proceeds in the trust account or because
we finance a portion of the consideration with our capital stock or debt
securities. In that event, the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any
other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of the
target businesses, which may include subsequent acquisitions.

    We have agreed to pay Innovation Interactive, LLC, an affiliate of
Messrs. Balter and Slasky, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the New
York, New York metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Innovation
Interactive, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated third party.

    We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $270,000) for
director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $150,000), with
the balance of $120,000 being held in reserve for other expenses of structuring
and negotiating business combinations, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We have reserved approximately
$105,000 for reimbursement of expenses incurred in connection with conducting
due diligence reviews of prospective target businesses. We expect that due
diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of
our officers, directors and existing stockholders and may include engaging
market research and valuation firms, as well as other third party consultants.
None of our officers, directors or existing stockholders will receive any
compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while performing due
diligence of prospective target businesses. Any reimbursement of out-of-pocket
expenses would be in our discretion. To the extent such out-of-pocket expenses
exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account, such
out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate a
business combination. We will not require, however, that the reimbursement of
out-of-pocket expenses be included as a term or condition in any agreement with
respect to a business combination. In addition, we may opt to make down payments
or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with structuring and
negotiating a business combination. We have not reserved any specific amounts
for such payments or fees. Any such payments or fees would have the effect of
reducing the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account for payment
of our ongoing expenses and reimbursement of out-of-pocket expenses incurred on
our behalf.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the report of
Eisner LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, contains a going
concern qualification.

    The amount of available proceeds is based on management’s estimates of the
costs needed to fund our operations for the next 24 months and consummate a
business combination. Those estimates may prove inaccurate, especially if a
portion of the available proceeds is used to make a down payment or pay
exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a business combination or if we
expend a significant portion of the available proceeds in pursuit of a business
combination that is not consummated. If we do not have sufficient proceeds
available to fund our expenses, we may be forced to obtain additional financing,
either from our management or the existing stockholders or from third parties.
We may not be able to obtain additional financing and our existing stockholders
and management are not obligated to provide any additional financing. If we do
not have sufficient proceeds and cannot find additional financing, we may be
forced to liquidate prior to consummating a business combination.

    Messrs. Balter and Slasky have loaned a total of $150,000 to us for the
payment of offering expenses. The loans bear interest at a rate of 4% per year
and will be payable on the earlier of April 11, 2006 or the consummation 
of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the net proceeds
of this offering not being placed in the trust account.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in money market funds meeting
conditions of the Investment Company Act of 1940 or securities issued or
guaranteed by the United States so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act of 1940. The interest income derived
from investment of the net proceeds not held in the trust account during this
period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

    No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or, other than the payment of $7,500
per month to Innovation Interactive, LLC in connection with the general and
administrative services arrangement, any of their affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as participating in the offering process, identifying potential
target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account (net of taxes payable on income of the funds in the trust account)) only
in the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business
combination or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert such shares
into cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder
previously voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

the 12,600,000 units, after deducting estimated offering expenses and
structuring fees payable by us of approximately $3.5 million and underwriting
discounts and commissions. The underwriters did not receive any discount or
commission on the 2,178,571 units offered to entities controlled by Dan L.
Duncan (1,821,428 of which were not underwritten and will be sold directly by us
to the employee partnership) or on the 178,571 units offered to O.S. Andras, a
director of Enterprise Products GP. If the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional units in full, we will receive aggregate net proceeds of
approximately $374.6 million.

We will enter into a new $525 million credit facility concurrently with the
closing of this offering. Affiliates of Citigroup, Lehman Brothers and Natexis
Bleichroeder will be lenders under our new credit facility and will be partially
repaid with the net proceeds of this offering. As a result, these underwriters
may be deemed to have a conflict of interest with respect to this offering
because they have interests in the successful completion of this offering beyond
the underwriting discount and commissions they will receive.

We will use all of the net proceeds from this offering to repay approximately
$332.1 million of indebtedness outstanding under our new credit facility. Net
proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional
units will also be used to repay indebtedness under our new credit facility We
expect to incur $525.0 million of indebtedness under this new facility which
will be used to repay an aggregate of $525.0 million of indebtedness, consisting
of (i) the indebtedness owed by Enterprise Products GP to Dan Duncan LLC that
was originally incurred to finance Enterprise Products GP’s purchase of a 50%
interest in GulfTerra’s general partner ($364.7 million as of June 30, 2005) and
(ii) the portion of the indebtedness owed to EPCO to be assumed by us from an
affiliate of EPCO as part of the contribution to us by that affiliate of
13,454,498 Enterprise Products Partners common units and a 9.9% member interest
in Enterprise Products GP ($160.3 million as of June 30, 2005). Any reduction of
the indebtedness owed by Enterprise Products GP to Dan Duncan LLC prior to the
closing date of this offering will result in a corresponding increase in the
amount of indebtedness owed to EPCO that we will assume on the closing date, so
that the total amount of indebtedness to be repaid with proceeds from the credit
facility will be $525.0 million.

Immediately after the closing of this offering, we expect to have borrowings of
approximately $192.9 million outstanding under our new credit facility bearing
interest at approximately 6.0% per annum. This facility will have a maturity
date in February 2006; however, we intend to refinance this indebtedness with a
multi-year credit facility prior to this maturity date."

underwriting discounts and commissions and non-accountable expense allowance of
$1.71 million and our estimated offering expenses of $.65 million, will be
approximately $14.70 million based on the initial offering price of $11.00 per
share. We intend to apply the net proceeds of the offering over a 24 month
period as follows:

(1)
   º We intend to acquire two fixed site ready-mix concrete production plants at
     an average cost of $.5 million per plant and one portable ready-mix
     concrete production plant at an approximate cost of $.25 million. Each
     plant requires a front-end loader, which is used to move the raw material
     from the storage area to the feeder bins of the production plant, at an
     approximate cost of $.25 million each. Proceeds will also be used to
     acquire a small crushing plant for $1.0 million and approximately
     $.65 million will be used to replace aging equipment in current operations.
     We intend to lease one ready-mix production facility and purchase the
     other, an aggregate of $1.0 million. Proceeds will be used to improve each
     new plant location site ranging from $.2 million to $.4 million per site.

(2)
   º The amount represents the balance due to Meadow Valley as of June 30, 2005
     for working capital advances, carries an interest rate of prime plus 1.25%
     and is due on demand. As of June 30, 2005 the interest rate was 7.5% per
     annum.

(3)
   º The amount represents the balance due to Meadow Valley for the intercompany
     income tax allocation payable as of June 30, 2005. The intercompany income
     tax payable is non-interest bearing and is due on demand.

(4)
   º Working capital may vary as a result of any additional advances from or
     repayments to Meadow Valley.

(5)
   º We intend to lease approximately 38 additional ready-mix trucks, in
     addition to the 22 already leased in 2005, through traditional operating
     leases, which typically require a down payment of the first and last months
     rent. We plan to fund these down payments through funds provided by
     operations and the working capital obtained from the proceeds of the
     offering. The addition of the mixer trucks would not have a material impact
     on our balance sheet as the lease expense incurred each month would impact
     our statement of operations. The trucks will be leased when we acquire the
     additional ready-mix production plants as discussed elsewhere in this
     prospectus. If we are unable to utilize the new equipment efficiently, we
     could suffer additional reductions in our working capital. We currently do
     not have a firm commitment from any lessors to provide lease financing for
     these transactions, but we believe that our relationships with our current
     financial institutions should enable us to do so. Based on product demand
     we may also seek to acquire additional equipment through traditional bank
     financing. If we are unable to obtain additional financing, we may be
     required to lease equipment we intended to purchase, lease land for the new
     production facility sites instead of acquiring it, or slow our growth.
                                       
    Since our formation, Meadow Valley has provided us with working capital to
support our operations which, until January 1, 2004, was treated as a current
non-interest bearing liability. This sum was partially repaid in 2003 and 2002
although Meadow Valley lent us funds again in 2004. See Note 9 to ""Financial
Statements."" In addition, Meadow Valley has a tax loss carryforward permitting
it to shelter future income. Under a tax sharing agreement with Meadow Valley,
we used a portion of that net loss carryforward to offset income taxes due
beginning in 2002. In turn, we agreed to repay the benefits we received, which
sum is listed as an intercompany income tax allocation payable.

    The underwriters' overallotment option provides for the issuance of 232,500
additional shares for additional net proceeds of $2,352,900, based on the
initial offering price of $11.00 per share. Any proceeds obtained upon exercise
of the overallotment option will be added to working capital. Future events may
require us to reallocate the offering proceeds although we have no present
intention of doing so.

    In addition, the net proceeds above do not assume exercise of warrants
issuable to the underwriters. The underwriters will receive warrants to purchase
up to 71/2% of the total number of shares sold in this offering (excluding the
over-allotment option)."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we          
      received from our directors described below. These funds will be repaid out 
      of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon             
      consummation of this offering.                                              

$45,050,000, or $52,164,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $1,370,000. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $730,000) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $80,000), with the balance of
$650,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds
not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision
with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not
have any current intention to do so. If we did, the amount that would be used as
a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision would be determined based on the
terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our available funds
at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or 
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching 
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

Our directors have collectively advanced to us a total of $100,000 which was
used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line
items above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and legal and audit fees
and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of April
21, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of
the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so that
we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this
period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar
fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors or stockholders,
or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order
to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder converts such
shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we consummate. In no other circumstances
will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the
trust account."

sale of 5,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and structuring fees but before paying
estimated offering expenses. We base this amount on the initial public offering
price of $21.50 per common unit.

    We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to:

   •  distribute $58.7 million to affiliates of Williams, in part to reimburse    
      Williams for capital expenditures relating to the assets contributed to us; 
  
   •  provide $24.4 million to make a capital contribution to Discovery to fund an
      escrow account required in connection with the Tahiti pipeline lateral      
      expansion project;

      formation transactions.                                                     

The $12.8 million of additional working capital includes $7.4 million to offset
an estimated balance of an equal amount of deferred revenues as of June 30,
2005. 

    We will not receive any proceeds from any common units to be sold by the
selling unitholders upon any exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units."

common stock being offered in this offering, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$377.8 million.

    We intend to use:

        º approximately $59.9 million of the net proceeds to repay the
          outstanding principal amount of the pay-in-kind loans and pay a
          prepayment premium, and approximately $120.7 million of the net
          proceeds to redeem the outstanding principal amount of the pay-in-kind
          notes and pay a redemption premium;

        º approximately $85.2 million of the net proceeds to redeem the
          outstanding principal amount of the senior discount notes, which are
          held by an affiliate of KKR;

        º approximately $60.7 million of the net proceeds to redeem up to
          approximately $52.5 million, or up to 14%, of the 2011 notes and pay a
          redemption premium and accrued and unpaid interest;

        º approximately $36.7 million of the net proceeds to redeem all
          outstanding shares of our redeemable convertible preferred stock,
          which are held by an affiliate of KKR, and pay a redemption premium
          and accumulated and unpaid dividends; and

        º $10.0 million of the net proceeds to terminate the management services
          agreement with affiliates of KKR and DLJMB III.

    These amounts are based on the accreted value, the outstanding principal
amount, the accrued and unpaid interest and the accumulated and unpaid dividends
on the applicable securities being repaid or redeemed as of March 31, 2005. The
actual amounts we pay to repay or redeem the securities will increase from the
amounts shown above. Except with respect to the pay-in-kind loans and notes,
each of these repayments and redemptions is voluntary.

    $131.9 million, or approximately 35%, of the net proceeds will be paid to
our affiliates that are affiliates of KKR and DLJMB III. This amount consists of
approximately $85.2 million to redeem the 12% senior discount notes held by an
affiliate of KKR, approximately $36.7 million to redeem the 15% redeemable
convertible preferred stock held by an affiliate of KKR and $10.0 million to
terminate the management services agreement with affiliates of KKR and
DLJMB III. This amount does not include underwriting discounts and commissions
to be received by CSFB, an affiliate of DLJMB III, in its capacity as
underwriter. Five of the eight members of our board of directors that approved
the offering are affiliated with KKR; two are affiliated with DLJMB III; one,
our chairman, is our chief executive officer. That eight member board of
directors voted unanimously to approve the offering.

    We intend to use any net proceeds we receive from any shares sold pursuant
to the underwriters' over-allotment option, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions, to redeem additional 2011 notes and pay a redemption
premium and accrued and unpaid interest.

    The pay-in-kind loans and pay-in-kind notes, which were incurred and issued
by our direct subsidiary Rockwood Specialties Consolidated, Inc., accrue
interest at the rate of 15% per year and mature on November 20, 2011 and
January 31, 2015, respectively. Interest is paid on the pay-in-kind loans and
pay-in-kind notes by increasing the principal amount outstanding rather than
making cash payments. The senior discount notes, which were issued by our
indirect subsidiary Rockwood Specialties International, Inc., accrue interest at
the rate of 12% per year, but do not require cash interest payment until 2007,
and mature on August 15, 2011. The 2011 notes, which were issued by Group,
accrue interest at the rate of 105/8% per year and mature on May 15, 2011. The
redeemable convertible preferred stock accumulates dividends at 15% per year of
the sum of (i) $1,000 original issue price per share and (ii) accumulated and
unpaid dividends on such share from the original issue date."

contingencies such as the timing and expenses for the construction of
restaurants currently under development and our ability to identify appropriate
sites for future restaurants. Depending upon the outcome of these contingencies,
we may allocate substantially greater or lesser amounts to new restaurant
development and to working capital and general corporate purposes. Pending the
uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds in short-term,

    •   to repay $13.0 million in principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest
        under our loan from Alpha Investors LLC, an entity controlled by Wexford.  
        The outstanding principal balance of the loan plus accrued but unpaid      
        interest must be repaid in full upon earlier to occur of the completion of 
        this offering and the maturity of the loan on July 1, 2006. Borrowings     
        under our loan with Alpha bear interest at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 5%   
        until September 30, 2005 (effective rate of 8.11% when the loan was made on
        June 30, 2005), and thereafter at a rate equal to LIBOR plus 7.5%.         
        Borrowings under this loan were incurred on June 30, 2005 in connection    
        with our purchase of all the membership interests in Strata Drilling,      
        L.L.C. and Strata Property, L.L.C. and a related rig yard;                 

    •   to repay $5.0 million in principal amount plus accrued but unpaid interest 
        under our revolving credit facility with Solitair LLC, an entity controlled
        by Wexford. The outstanding principal balance bears interest at a rate     
        equal to LIBOR plus 5.0% (effective rate of 8.11% at June 30, 2005).       
        Payment of principal and accrued but unpaid interest is due on the maturity
        date of the credit facility which is the later of (1) six months after the 
        actual maturity date of our credit facility with GECC and (2) December 1,  
        2010. Borrowings under this credit facility were used primarily for the    
        refurbishment of our rig fleet. See “Certain Relationships and Related     
        Party Transactions – Credit Facilities” for further information regarding  
        the Alpha loan and Solitair credit facility; and                           

    •   together with cash from operations, to refurbish rigs in our inventory at  
        estimated costs ranging from $4.1 million to $6.8 million per rig and for  
        general corporate purposes, which may include the purchase of additional   
        rigs. We plan on refurbishing five additional inventoried rigs during the  
        balance of 2005 and six inventoried rigs during 2006. Initially, we intend 
        to focus our refurbishment efforts on our higher horsepower rigs. The      
        amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon market and  
        other factors.                                                             

Pending the use of the remaining net proceeds for refurbishment and general
corporate purposes, we may repay a portion or all of our outstanding borrowings
under one or more of the following credit facilities:

    •   Our credit facility with General Electric Capital Corporation, or GECC,    
        provides for a series of term loans up to a maximum amount of $25.5 million
        which bear interest at a rate equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate,  
        or LIBOR, plus 5.0% (effective rate of 8.11% at June 30, 2005) and are     
        secured by substantially all of our property and assets, including our     
        drilling rigs and associated equipment, but excluding cash and accounts    
        receivable. Payments of principal and accrued but unpaid interest are due  
        on the first day of each month. The credit facility matures on October 1,  
        2010. Our outstanding balance under this credit facility was $19.5 million 
        at June 30, 2005. Borrowings under this credit facility were used primarily
        for the refurbishment of our rig fleet.                                    

    •   Our line of credit with International Bank of Commerce, as amended to date,
        has a borrowing base of the lesser of $3.0 million or 80% of current       
        receivables. Borrowings under this line bear interest at a rate equal to   
        the greater of 4.0% or JPMorgan Chase prime (effective rate of 6.25% at    
        June 30, 2005) and are guaranteed by entities controlled by Wexford.       
        Accrued but unpaid interest is payable monthly. The line of credit matures 
        on November 1, 2005. Borrowings under this line of credit were used        
        primarily for the refurbishment of our rig fleet. At June 30, 2005, our 
        outstanding borrowings under this line of credit were $2.5 million.               

In connection with the consummation of this offering, we expect to enter into a
new senior secured revolving credit facility. The new credit facility would be
used to refinance existing indebtedness, fund the refurbishment and repair of
inventoried rigs and fund future rig acquisitions and working capital
requirements. However, we have not received a commitment from a financial
institution with respect to such a facility, and we can give you no assurance
that we will receive such a commitment or if we do, that it will be on favorable
terms."

interest at the prime rate.

outstanding indebtedness to KeyBank National Association and to use the
remainder for general corporate purposes, including to fund working capital and

We intend to use approximately $35.5 million of the net proceeds of this

complete during the third quarter of 2005.

in liquid short term securities. The precise amounts and timing of our use of
the net proceeds will depend upon market conditions and the availability of

We currently intend to use the proceeds of this offering to fund the growth of
our business and for general corporate purposes. We estimate that we will use
the proceeds of this offering as follows:

          Actilon including expansion of ongoing Phase Ib clinical trials of       
          Actilon in HCV to explore higher doses and different dosing schedules,

          respiratory diseases by identifying new TLR Therapeutic product          
          candidates and advancing them from preclinical development up to the     
          initiation of Phase II clinical trials; and                              
 
      †   approximately $22 million to fund working capital, capital expenditures, 
          prosecution and maintenance of our patents and other corporate purposes. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts that we actually expend
for these purposes may vary significantly depending on a number of factors. The
amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend upon numerous factors
including the results of our research and development efforts, the timing and
success of preclinical testing, the timing and success of any clinical trials we
may commence in the future, the timing of regulatory submissions, the amount of
proceeds actually raised in this offering and the amount of cash, if any,
generated by our collaboration agreements. We may change the allocation of use
of proceeds as a result of contingencies such as the progress and results of our
clinical trials and other research and development activities, the establishment
of collaborations and regulatory or competitive developments. As a result,
management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds
from this offering. We have no current plans, agreements or commitments for
acquisitions of any businesses, products or technologies.

We do not expect the net proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to fund
the completion of the development of any of our product candidates and we expect
that we will need to raise additional funds prior to being able to market any
products.

Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the net
proceeds in accordance with our investment policy guidelines, which provide for
investment of funds in cash equivalents, United States government obligations,

cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above.

     annum until the actual redemption date. We expect to redeem the junior
     preferred stock on August 12, 2005. As of such date, the aggregate
     redemption price, including accrued and unpaid dividends, will be
     approximately $184.4 million.

   º If the underwriters' option to purchase additional shares is exercised, we
     will use the net proceeds therefrom to pay a second special cash dividend
     to our common stockholders of record immediately prior to this offering.
     Assuming such option is exercised in full, a second special cash dividend
     of approximately $44.2 million will be paid."

price of our initial fleet. Based on the initial public offering price of $21.00
per share, the purchase price of our initial fleet will be equal to:

    •   the proceeds from our sale of 28,570,000 common shares in this offering net
        of the underwriting discount and structuring fee ($562.5 million), plus    

    •   the proceeds from our concurrent sale of 7,145,000 subordinated shares     
        ($150.0 million), less                                                     

    •   our formation and offering related expenses (estimated at $6.3 million)    
        some of which are payable after closing, less                              

    •   a specified cash balance of $33.8 million to be used by us as described    
        below, less                                                                

    •   $7.5 million in upfront costs related to our credit facility, less

    •   $0.5 million to repay SCLL for certain of our pre-offering expenses that it
        has funded.                                                                

Based on the initial public offering price of $21.00 per share, the purchase
price for our initial fleet will be approximately $664.4 million. We expect to
use a portion of the specified cash balance in the fourth bullet above to fund
approximately $4.1 million of the dividends on our subordinated shares we expect
to pay in the initial three quarters following the closing of this offering and
the remainder of the specified cash balance to fund part of the purchase price
of the additional 13 containerships in our contracted fleet. The total purchase
price for the additional 13 containerships is approximately $849.3 million. The
balance of the funds needed to acquire the additional 13 containerships is
expected to come from our credit facility and a future offering or offerings of
our common shares. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option,
those net proceeds will be added to the specified cash balance. We have the
option to issue common shares in payment of up to $100.0 million of the purchase
price for the last four of the additional 13 containerships. We must provide
notice that we will exercise this option 30 days prior to the delivery of the
respective vessel. Such common shares would be issued to the relevant VesselCo
on the closing date of the purchase of the applicable vessel and would be valued
at a net price equal to 95% of the initial public offering price in this
offering. The VesselCos are not obligated to accept the common shares if we are
in a material default under our credit facility. If the VesselCos do not accept
the common shares in such a case, we are not obligated to purchase the
respective vessel. The option terminates upon a change of control of us.
Otherwise, the option is not revocable by the VesselCos.

We are acquiring our contracted fleet from wholly owned subsidiaries of SCLL and
the purchase price was determined between us and SCLL before this offering."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
      received from Kerry Propper and Chardan Capital Partners described below.
      These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being
      placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

      $25,835,000, or $29,835,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers Inc. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination.

      The payment to Chardan Capital, LLC, an affiliate of Dr. Richard D.
Propper, our chairman of the board, Li Zhang, our chief executive officer, and
Jiangnan Huang, our executive vice president, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. Chardan Capital, LLC will also be paid a similar monthly
fee of $7,500 for general and administrative services to be used by Chardan
China III. This arrangement is being agreed to by Chardan Capital, LLC for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Dr. Propper and Messrs. Zhang and Huang
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the San Diego metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
Chardan Capital, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders, we will no longer
be required to pay this monthly fee.

      We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $545,000, or
$685,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $80,000), with the balance
of $465,000, or $605,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business. Although we do not have any current
intention to do so, we could also use a portion of the funds not being placed in
trust as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination. If we did, the amount that would be
used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be determined
based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our
available funds at the time. Forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of
our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to
continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential
target businesses.

      To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

      Kerry Propper, our chief financial officer, secretary and director, and
Chardan Capital Partners, one of our stockholders, have advanced to us a total
of $80,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without
interest on the earlier of April 11, 2006 or the consummation of this offering.
The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
in trust.

      The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so that
we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this
period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.

      We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

      Commencing on the date of this prospectus through the consummation of the
acquisition of the target business, we will pay Chardan Capital, LLC the fee
described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors or stockholders, or any
of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

      A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account."

approximately US$77.0 million, or approximately US$89.2 million if the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and the offering expenses payable by us. We
will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs by the selling
shareholders.

As of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated any specific portion of
the net proceeds of this offering for any particular purpose discussed below. We
may use the net proceeds to purchase software, hardware or services, hire
personnel, acquire businesses or assets, or for other general corporate
purposes. We plan to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering as
follows:

      •   to enhance our user experience by:

      •   investing in the research and development of core search engine technology;

      •    investing in the development of new products and services, although we  
           have not identified any specific new products or services in which we   
           plan to make significant investments in the near future;                

      •    acquiring additional bandwidth and servers to expand our network        
           capacity; and                                                           

      •    acquiring products or technologies that we believe will help us enhance 
           our user experience;                                                    

      •   to expand our customer base by:

      •   developing innovative online marketing products and services;


      •   improving the effectiveness and efficiency of our distribution network;

      •    further promoting our brand and enhancing our efforts to market our     
           products and services; and                                              

      •    acquiring businesses that may help us further expand our online         
           marketing services; and                                                 

      •   for general corporate purposes.

We expect to allocate our distribution, branding and marketing resources
according to our business needs. We do not have any current plan to concentrate
our resources on specific geographic region or industry.

In utilizing the proceeds of this offering, we may make loans to Baidu Online
and Baidu Netcom, or we may subscribe to equity interests of these entities. Any
loans to or investment in Baidu Online or Baidu Netcom are subject to PRC
government approval. For example:

    •   loans by us to Baidu Online, as a wholly foreign-owned enterprise, to      
        finance its activities cannot exceed statutory limits and must be          
        registered with the SAFE; and                                              

    •   loans by us to Baidu Netcom, which is a domestic PRC enterprise, must be   
        approved in accordance with PRC law.                                       

We may also decide to finance Baidu Online by subscribing to its equity
interest, which is subject to approval of the Ministry of Commerce or its local
counterpart. Since Baidu Netcom holds the license for Internet content services,
or the ICP license, we are not likely to finance its activities by subscribing
to its equity interest as regulations limit our ability to hold equity 
interests in an Internet content provider. We cannot assure you that we can 
obtain these government registrations or approvals on a timely basis, if at all,
with respect to our future loans to or investment in Baidu Online or Baidu Netcom.

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus.

We intend to invest any additional net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing,
debt instruments or bank deposits. These investments may have a material adverse
effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your investment in our
ADSs."
"ADVANCED LIFE SCIENCES HOLDINGS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/advanced-life-sciences-holdings-inc-671915-44300,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/advanced-life-sciences-holdings-inc-671915-44300,424B4,8/5/2005,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=3835625,"We estimate that the net proceeds from the sale of our common stock in the
initial public offering will be approximately $28.5 million after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $33.0 million.

    We currently intend to use the net proceeds from the initial public offering
as follows:

        º $8.0 million for a payment to Abbott Laboratories under our license
          agreement, which is due and payable on the earlier of September 1,
          2005 or five days following the closing of the offerings;

        º $2.0 million for a payment to Abbott Laboratories on October 31, 2005
          or, if earlier, upon our initiation of pivotal Phase III clinical
          trials for cethromycin; and

        º $18.5 million over approximately the next 18 months to conduct pivotal
          Phase III clinical trials for cethromycin in the treatment of
          mild-to-moderate community acquired pneumonia.

    We intend to use any remaining net proceeds from the initial public offering
for working capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes,
including, potentially, depending on the amount of proceeds, clinical trials of
ALS-886, ALS-357 and, subject to reaching a satisfactory agreement with our
joint venture partner, Calanolide A, research and development in the discovery
of new compounds, potential acquisitions of product candidates through
in-licensing activities and continued laboratory studies of preclinical product
candidates.

    We believe that the net proceeds from the initial public offering will be
sufficient to meet our anticipated operating requirements through 2006. We
expect to satisfy our future cash needs through the sale of equity securities,
debt financings, corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements and grant
funding, as well as through interest income earned on cash balances.

    As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of
the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of
the offerings. The amount and timing of our expenditures will depend on several
factors, including the progress of our clinical trials and research and
development efforts as well as the amount of cash used in our operations.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds of the initial public offering. We
reserve the right to change the use of these proceeds as a result of certain
contingencies such as the results of our drug discovery and development
activities, competitive developments, opportunities to acquire products,
technologies or businesses and other factors.

    We have no current agreements or commitments for acquisitions of
complementary businesses or technologies. Pending these uses, we will invest the
net proceeds of the initial public offering in short-term, investment grade and
interest-bearing securities.

    Concurrent with the shares we are offering by this prospectus in the initial
public offering, we are also offering 600,000 shares of our common stock to
Abbott Laboratories in exchange for a $3.0 million reduction of a $5.0 million
milestone obligation under our license agreement with Abbott that is payable on
October 31, 2005, or, if earlier, upon our initiation of pivotal Phase III
clinical trials for cethromycin."

common stock we are offering will be approximately $41.9 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option
in full, we estimate the net proceeds to us from this offering will be
approximately $43.6 million. We will not receive any proceeds from any sale of
common stock by the selling shareholders.

We intend to use $6.5 million of the net proceeds of this offering to acquire
Enable contemporaneously with the closing of this offering pursuant to an
executed merger agreement. Enable is the manufacturer of our Isolator
handpieces, which are an essential part of our system, the sales to us of which
constitute substantially all of the current revenues of Enable. Three of the
members of our board of directors, directly or indirectly, hold an aggregate of
approximately 63% of the outstanding common stock of Enable and, accordingly,
will receive a majority of the amounts that we pay to acquire Enable. None of
these persons individually holds a majority of the outstanding common stock of
Enable nor are we aware that these persons are acting collectively as a group.
One of these three directors, Michael Hooven, our Chief Technology Officer, is
also a director, an officer and a shareholder of Enable. 

We intend to use the remaining proceeds from this offering for working capital
and other general corporate purposes, including obligations under an Ohio grant
program in which we anticipate participating, repayment of amounts outstanding
under our credit facility and obligations under a recently executed development
and license agreement with UST Inc. The Cleveland Clinic Foundation and Case
Western Reserve University and collaborating businesses, including us, received
publicly announced grants from the State of Ohio for the creation of the Atrial
Fibrillation Innovation Center. The grants are intended to enable the center to
develop both surgical and non-invasive treatments to help prevent and
potentially cure atrial fibrillation. While we have not yet executed final grant
documents, we anticipate receiving from the grant approximately $0.9 million for
operating expenses and approximately $2.1 million for capital expenses, each
over a three-year period. Over the same three-year period, we anticipate being
required by the grant terms to provide approximately $7.7 million for operating
expenses and approximately $4.8 million for capital expenses at our facility,
which amounts represent ordinary course expenditures that we anticipate that we
would otherwise have made. Additionally, we are planning to establish an office
at the Cleveland Clinic staffed with our engineers.

We entered into a $5.0 million credit facility on March 8, 2005 for working
capital requirements. Outstanding borrowings under the facility bear interest at
the prime rate plus 1.75% and our ability to draw down funds under this facility
terminates upon the earlier of September 1, 2005 and the closing of this
offering, and upon other specified events. Under the terms of the facility, we
are required to pay only monthly installments of interest through August 2005
and monthly installments of principal and interest thereafter in addition to a
fee due at maturity on September 1, 2009 equal to 15% of the aggregate amount
borrowed under the credit facility, with prepayment in whole allowed at any time
without penalty. As of July 31, 2005, $1.5 million in principal was outstanding
under this facility. We intend to use proceeds from this offering to repay
amounts borrowed under this credit facility plus interest and fees.

In July 2005, we entered into a development and license agreement with UST Inc.
pursuant to which we are obligated to pay development fees aggregating
approximately $1.3 million over the next fourteen months.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to expand our sales organization
and distribution channels and to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,
products or technologies in addition to Enable. Although we have no specific
plans with respect to other acquisitions, we evaluate acquisition opportunities
and engage in related discussions from time to time.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds from this offering. Pending use of the net
proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the net proceeds in a variety
of capital preservation investments, including short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing instruments."

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
      received from Kerry Propper and Chardan Capital Partners described below.
      These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being
      placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

      $25,835,000, or $29,835,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers Inc. maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust
account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business
combination.

      The payment to Chardan Capital, LLC, an affiliate of Jiangnan Huang, our
chairman of the board, Dr. Richard D. Propper, our chief financial officer, and
Li Zhang, our executive vice president, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for
general and administrative services including office space, utilities and
secretarial support. Chardan Capital, LLC will also be paid a similar monthly
fee of $7,500 for general and administrative services to be used by Chardan
China II. This arrangement is being agreed to by Chardan Capital, LLC for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Dr. Propper and Messrs. Zhang and Huang
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the San Diego metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
Chardan Capital, LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders, we will no longer
be required to pay this monthly fee.

      We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $545,000, or
$685,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $80,000), with the balance
of $465,000, or $605,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business. Although we do not have any current
intention to do so, we could also use a portion of the funds not being placed in
trust as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination. If we did, the amount that would be
used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be determined
based on the terms of the specific business combination and the amount of our
available funds at the time. Forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of
our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to
continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential
target businesses.

      To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
the operations of the target business.

      Kerry Propper, our chief executive officer, secretary and director, and
Chardan Capital Partners, one of our stockholders, have advanced to us a total
of $80,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal and audit fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without
interest on the earlier of April 11, 2006 or the consummation of this offering.
The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed
in trust.

      The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States ""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of
the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less so that
we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act.
The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds during this
period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well
as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations, including
associated professional fees, until a business combination is completed.    

      We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time.

      Commencing on the date of this prospectus through the consummation of the
acquisition of the target business, we will pay Chardan Capital, LLC the fee
described above. Other than this $7,500 per month administrative fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's, consulting or other similar fees)
will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors or stockholders, or any
of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to
effectuate, the consummation of the business combination. However, such
individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

      A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert such shares into cash in connection with a business
combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account."

common stock being offered hereby, after deducting underwriting discounts, will
be approximately $533.0 million. We intend to use approximately $55.1 million of
the net proceeds to redeem $50.0 million face value of the $420 million
aggregate principal amount of our 73/8% senior subordinated notes due 2014,
including the payment of the applicable redemption premium and accrued interest
to the expected redemption date. The proceeds from the 73/8% senior subordinated
notes were used, together with other related financings, to finance the
acquisition and to pay related transaction fees and expenses incurred in
connection with the acquisition and the related financings. We intend to use net
proceeds of approximately $477.9 million to pay a dividend to our stockholders
existing immediately prior to the offering, consisting of affiliates of First
Reserve and certain members of senior management. Of such amount, approximately
$468.6 million will be received by affiliates of First Reserve. In addition,
approximately $6.7 million will be received by certain of our executive
officers, consisting of Mr. Volpe ($2,180,487), Mr. Anthony ($1,044,708),
Mr. Riordan ($545,122), Mr. Nye ($272,563), Mr. Dickson ($544,895), Mr. Rossi
($547,610), Mr. Chevrier ($283,246), Ms. Powers ($981,222) and Mr. Rinicella
($332,509), and approximately $2.6 million will be received by 30 other
employees in the aggregate. We will pay the estimated offering expenses of
$2.4 million out of cash on hand.

    We also intend to use the net proceeds we receive from any shares sold
pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, after deducting
underwriting discounts, to pay an additional dividend to our existing
stockholders. In the event the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment
option, the amount of this dividend will be approximately $79.9 million. Of such
amount, approximately $78.4 million will be received by affiliates of First
Reserve. In addition, approximately $1.1 million will be received by certain of
our executive officers, consisting of Mr. Volpe ($364,762), Mr. Anthony
($174,764), Mr. Riordan ($91,191), Mr. Nye ($45,596), Mr. Dickson ($91,153),
Mr. Rossi ($91,607), Mr. Chevrier ($47,383), Ms. Powers ($164,143) and
Mr. Rinicella ($55,624), and approximately $0.4 million will be received by 30
other employees in the aggregate.

    Some of the underwriters or their affiliates may from time to time hold some
of the 73/8% senior subordinated notes through ordinary trading or market-making
activities. In the event that an underwriter or affiliate holds any notes on the
record date for the redemption, such entity may receive a portion of the
proceeds from this offering. The trustee under the indenture governing the notes
will select the appropriate method of selecting the notes for redemption, which
we expect will approximate a pro rata redemption."

the 9,000,000 shares of common stock offered by us at the initial public
offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling stockholders
in this offering. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in
full, we estimate that we will receive additional net proceeds of approximately
$14.8 million.

The principal purposes for this offering are to increase our working capital,
create a public market for our common stock, provide liquidity for our existing
stockholders, improve our ability to access the capital markets in the future
and for general corporate purposes. We may spend a portion of the net proceeds
on sales and marketing activities, on research and development activities,
general and administrative matters and on capital expenditures. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary businesses
or products or to obtain rights to such complementary technologies. We have no
commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or investments.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the cash used or generated in our operations, the status of
our product development efforts, sales and marketing activities, technological
advances and competitive pressures. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of
net proceeds to be used for all of the purposes described above. We may find it
necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will
have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest
bearing, investment grade securities. We have implemented and maintain a
prescribed investment policy in regards to our cash investments."

common stock in this offering, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts

option is exercised in full, we will receive additional aggregate net proceeds
of approximately $0.5 million and the selling stockholders will receive
aggregate net proceeds of approximately $10.0 million. We will not receive any
of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders in this offering.

    We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering as follows:

        º Approximately $56.7 million will be used to redeem approximately
          $50.6 million accreted value ($57.8 million principal amount) of our
          83/8% senior second secured notes due March 15, 2010 and to pay a
          $6.1 million premium due on redemption for these notes assuming that
          the redemption will occur on September 15, 2005;

        º Approximately $10.9 million will be used for general corporate
          purposes, including the expansion of our colocation network; and

        º Approximately $2.2 million will be used for the payment of fees and
          expenses associated with this offering.

    Approximately $19.9 million of the $50.6 million accreted value
($22.8 million principal amount) of our 83/8% senior second secured notes due
2010 being redeemed was incurred in November 2004. The proceeds from the
November 2004 notes offering were used to pay the consideration for ATI, to
repurchase certain shares of preferred stock and to pay fees and expenses of the
notes offering.

    The amounts we actually expend in such areas may vary significantly and will
depend on a variety of factors. As part of our strategy, we may make
acquisitions and a portion of the net proceeds from the offering may be used for
such purposes. We have no definitive agreements, arrangements or understandings
with respect to any particular acquisition or acquisitions, although we
regularly engage in discussions with other companies and assess acquisition
opportunities. We cannot assure you that such acquisition opportunities will be
available either on terms acceptable to us or at all."

India, approximately $40 million for capital expenditures, including an
estimated $20 million for the build-out of our terrestrial repeater network in
India; another approximately $110 million on business development activities in
China, Western Europe and other selected markets within our broadcast coverage

evaluate acquisition candidates in the animal health products distribution

proceeds of this offering. Factors that may impact the allocation of the
proceeds set forth herein include the nature, size and type of acquisitions that
we may pursue or a more rapid expansion of our operations than we currently
plan. For example, if we were to expand our operations more rapidly than our
current plans, a greater portion of the proceeds would likely be used for the
construction and expansion of facilities, working capital and other capital
expenditures. Alternatively, if we were to engage in an acquisition that
contained a significant cash component, some or all of the proceeds would be
used for that purpose. Pending specific utilization of the net proceeds as
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in

offered by us will be approximately $109.0 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $17.50 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    The primary purposes of the offering are to create a public market for our
common stock and to obtain additional capital. We will be retaining all of the
net proceeds of the offering and expect to use those proceeds for working
capital and general corporate purposes, including capital expenditures and
acquisitions. Management will have broad discretion as to the use of the net
proceeds from this offering. As described in “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations — Liquidity and
Capital Resources,” we anticipate capital expenditure requirements of
approximately $40 million during 2005 and 2006. Approximately $15 million of
this amount relates to the leasehold improvements of our new corporate office,
which was completed prior to this offering, and accordingly, was funded by our
Parent. The balance represents anticipated expenditures to enhance our Web site
infrastructure. We may also be required to make contingent consideration
payments of up to an aggregate of $25 million related to the RxList, MedicineNet
and HealthShare acquisitions achieving certain milestones.

    We currently are not a party to any definitive agreement or other commitment
with respect to future acquisitions. However, we expect to continue to
supplement our internal product development efforts with strategic acquisitions
that add new capabilities or help us enter additional complementary markets, and
regularly engage in discussions as to potential acquisitions. We currently are
exploring the possibility of acquiring two complementary businesses in separate
transactions. We currently anticipate that the purchase price paid for each of
these businesses would, if a transaction were consummated, be approximately
$20 million, and would be paid exclusively in cash. However, we have not entered
into any definitive agreements or other commitments with respect to either of
these potential acquisitions, and there can be no assurances that either of
these transactions will be completed.

    We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the additional
$40 million capital contribution that our Parent has contributed to us, together
with our available cash resources and future cash flow from operations, will
provide sufficient cash resources to fund these two potential acquisitions, to
meet the commitments described above and to fund our currently anticipated
working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next
twenty four months.

    The amounts actually expended for each purpose and the timing of such
expenditures will depend on a number of factors, including our realization of
the different elements of our growth strategy and the amount of cash generated
by our operations. Pending their use, the proceeds of the offering will be
invested in interest-bearing securities."

$5.0 million in capital expenditures in the 12-month period after December 31,
2004, primarily to acquire additional hosting infrastructure. We have no present

sale of 4,900,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions but before paying estimated
offering expenses.

    We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to:

        º repay $51.0 million of outstanding indebtedness under a term loan of
          Global Petroleum Corp. and certain other Slifka family entities
          guaranteed by affiliates of Global Petroleum Corp., including Global
          Companies LLC, Glen Hes Corp., Global Montello Group LLC and Chelsea

          credit facility; and

          formation transactions.

    The $51.0 million term loan of Global Petroleum Corp. and certain other
Slifka family entities that was guaranteed by affiliates of Global Petroleum
Corp., including Global Companies LLC, Glen Hes Corp., Global Montello Group LLC
and Chelsea Sandwich LLC, was entered into in July 2004. The proceeds of this
term loan were used (1) to finance the acquisition by Global Petroleum Corp. and
certain other Slifka family entities of the ownership interests in Global
Companies LLC, Glen Hes Corp., Global Montello Group LLC and Chelsea Sandwich
LLC, from RYTTSA USA, Inc. and (2) to refinance certain loans secured by the
real estate assets of Global Petroleum Corp. and certain other Slifka family
entities, including Global Companies LLC, Glen Hes Corp., Global Montello Group
LLC and Chelsea Sandwich LLC. The term loan bore interest at 6.15% at June 30,
2005 and matures in July 2009. The term loan and associated financing costs and
interest expense are included in the historical combined financial statements of
Global Companies LLC and Affiliates (Predecessor) included elsewhere in this
prospectus. Please read Note 7 of the Notes to the historical combined financial
statements of Global Companies LLC and Affiliates (Predecessor).

    Borrowings under our current revolving credit facility were primarily made
in connection with our working capital needs. As of June 30, 2005, we had
borrowings outstanding under this revolving credit facility of $104.9 million.
Indebtedness under the facility bore interest at an average rate of
approximately 4.8% in the six-month period ended June 30, 2005. This facility
matures in November 2005 but will be replaced with a four-year senior secured
credit agreement in an aggregate principal amount of up to $400.0 million.
Immediately following the closing of the offering, we intend to use the
additional borrowing capacity created by reducing our borrowings under our
revolving credit facility to replenish our working capital consistent with
levels seasonally appropriate for our volume of business. 

    Affiliates of certain underwriters are lenders under the $51.0 million term
loan of Global Petroleum Corp. and certain other Slifka family entities and
under our current credit facility. 

    The net proceeds from any exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase
additional common units will be used to redeem from affiliates of our general
partner a number of common units equal to the number of common units issued upon
exercise of the option at a price per common unit equal to the proceeds per
common unit before other expenses but after underwriting discounts and
commissions."

$25.4 million, or approximately $29.4 million if the underwriters exercise the
over-allotment option in full. This estimate is based on an initial public
offering price of $10.50 per share, after deducting the estimated underwriting
discount, commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We
currently anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering to fund:

   •  clinical development of AVN944;

   •  discovery of new drug candidates;                                           
  
   •  acquisition, licensing and protection of intellectual property rights; and  
  
   •  working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 

    We currently estimate that, of the net proceeds from this offering, we will
spend between $8 million and $12 million on the clinical development of AVN944,
between $5 million and $10 million on the development of additional lead
programs, including our †-catenin and Aurora kinase programs, and between $5
million and $10 million on the discovery of new drug candidates. The amounts,
timing and allocation of our actual expenditures for each of these purposes will
depend upon numerous factors, including the status of our research and
development efforts, the timing and success of preclinical testing, the timing
and success of any clinical trials we may commence in the future, the timing of
regulatory submissions, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering,
the amount of cash generated by our operations, the amount of competition we
face and how successful we are with obtaining any required licenses and entering
into collaboration arrangements. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for
the acquisition of, or investment in, companies, technologies, products or
assets that complement our business. However, we have no present understandings,
commitments or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions or
investments and accordingly we cannot estimate what portion of the net proceeds,
if any, may be used for those purposes. We do not anticipate using any of the
proceeds to expand our facilities.

    While we expect to allocate the net proceeds as described above, we may
allocate the proceeds in a different manner if we believe it would be in our
best interests to do so.

    Our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from
this offering in any manner we deem appropriate. We do not expect the net
proceeds from this offering to be sufficient to fund the completion of the
development of any drug candidate and we expect to need to raise additional
funds prior to being able to market any drug candidate. We believe that the net
proceeds of this offering, along with existing cash and cash equivalents and
cash flow generated from our collaborations, will be sufficient to meet our
capital requirements for at least the next 24 months.

    Following the expenditure of these proceeds, assuming success in our
clinical trials of AVN944, we expect to have concluded Phase II clinical trials
of AVN944. Assuming success in our lead optimization and preclinical efforts, we
believe that we will be involved in early stages of human clinical trials of
compounds discovered in our †-catenin and Aurora kinase programs after the
expenditure of these proceeds.

    Pending our usage of the net proceeds of the offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term investment grade
and U.S. government securities."

receive any proceeds from the sale of our ordinary shares by the selling

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for working capital to

to purchase up to 1,875,000 additional shares of common stock from us) after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated fees and
expenses incurred in connection with this offering and related transactions.

We intend to apply our net proceeds of this offering, together with our
available cash (not to exceed $40 million):

(i)  to the voluntary redemption, assumed for purposes of this prospectus to be
November 14, 2005, of approximately $40.3 million in accreted value of the 11%
senior discount notes due 2013, and to the payment of a related redemption
premium of approximately $4.4 million thereon;

(ii)  to the voluntary redemption, assumed for purposes of this prospectus to be
November 14, 2005, of $40.0 million of the outstanding aggregate principal
amount of the 9% senior notes due 2012, to the payment of a related redemption
premium of approximately $3.6 million thereon, and to the payment of accrued
interest of approximately $0.1 million thereon; and

(iii)  to the redemption, for a total redemption price of $62.2 million, of all
of our outstanding shares of Series A preferred stock, at their stated value.

The interest rate and maturity of the indebtedness that we intend to redeem
using our net proceeds from this offering, as well as the use of the net
proceeds from the original incurrence of such indebtedness, are described below:
9% Senior Notes.  On July 7, 2004, Horizon Lines and Horizon Lines Holding,
issued $250.0 million aggregate principal amount of 9% senior notes. The 9%
senior notes are guaranteed by HLH, LLC, Horizon Lines of Puerto Rico, Inc.,
Horizon Lines Ventures, LLC, Horizon Lines of Alaska, LLC, Horizon Lines of
Guam, LLC, Horizon Lines Vessels, LLC, Horizon Services Group, LLC, Sea-Logix,
LLC, S-L Distribution Service, LLC and SL Payroll Services, LLC. The 9% senior
notes mature on November 1, 2012. As of June 26, 2005, $250.0 million of
aggregate principal amount of 9% senior notes remained outstanding.

11% Senior Discount Notes.  On December 10, 2004, H-Lines Finance issued $160.0
million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 11% senior discount notes for
gross proceeds of approximately $112.3 million. Prior to April 1, 2008, interest
will accrue on the 11% senior discount notes in the form of an increase in their
accreted value. Cash interest payments will be due and payable beginning on
October 1, 2008. The 11% senior discount notes mature on April 1, 2013. As of
June 26, 2005, 11% senior discount notes with an accreted value of $119.0
million remained outstanding.

Horizon Lines Holding used the net proceeds from the offering of the 9% senior
notes to fund a portion of the consideration paid in connection with the
Acquisition-Related Transactions.

A cash dividend was paid by H-Lines Finance to the issuer from the proceeds of
the offering of the 11% senior discount notes in the amount of approximately
$107.4 million, which was then used by the issuer as follows: (i) approximately
$52.9 million thereof was used to pay in full the outstanding
principal and accrued interest on the 13% promissory notes in December 2004,
(ii) approximately $53.2 million thereof was used for the repurchase of
5,315,912 shares of its Series A preferred stock in December 2004,
(iii) approximately $0.5 million thereof was paid as an advisory fee to Castle
Harlan in December 2004 and (iv) approximately $0.5 million thereof was used for
the repurchase of 53,520 shares of its Series A preferred stock in January 2005.
H-Lines Finance used the remainder of the proceeds of the offering for the
payment of fees and expenses related to such offering.

The date(s) specified herein for the voluntary redemption of portions of the 11%
senior discount notes and the 9% senior notes reflect assumptions made solely
for purposes of the pro forma and other calculations set forth herein, are
subject to change at any time without notice to anyone, and should not be relied

of 8 3/4% senior subordinated notes due 2012 issued by Global Cash Access, Inc.

We intend to use $10.0 million of the net proceeds to acquire the patent
covering our “3-in-1 rollover” functionality. The remaining net proceeds that we

In addition to these uses of the net proceeds of this offering, the other
purposes of this offering are to enhance our ability to acquire other
businesses, products or technologies, to create a public market for our common
stock, to facilitate our future access to public equity markets, to provide
liquidity for our existing stockholders, to improve the effectiveness of our
stock option plans in attracting and retaining key employees, to increase the
visibility of our company in a marketplace in which several of our competitors
are publicly-held companies, and to provide our customers greater assurances as
to our long-term viability, which is enhanced by being subject to the financial
reporting and disclosure obligations of a public company. We may use a portion
of the net proceeds to acquire businesses that are complementary to our own, but
we currently have no commitments, agreements nor are we in any negotiations
relating to any of these types of transactions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the status of our
product development efforts, sales and marketing activities, technological
advances, amount of cash generated or used by our operations and competition. We
may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes,
and we will have broad discretion in the application of the balance of the net
proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds

(1)   A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we          
      received from our directors described below. These funds will be repaid out 
      of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon             
      consummation of this offering.                                              

(2)   The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $1,000,000  
      even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                    

$54,250,000, or $62,620,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Smith
Barney, a division of Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental
Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. The funds held
in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities,” within
the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940, having a
maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, or in money market funds
meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under
the Investment Company Act of 1940. The proceeds will not be released from the
trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or
our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination.

The payment to Royal Palm Capital Management, LLLP, an affiliate of Richard C.
Rochon, our chairman of the board and chief executive officer, Stephen J.
Ruzika, our vice chairman, and Jack I. Ruff, Mario B. Ferrari and Robert C.
Farenhem, each a vice president and member of our board of directors, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative services, including
office space, utilities and secretarial support. Richard C. Rochon is president
and director and owns a 54% interest in the general partner of Royal Palm
Capital Management and Jack J. Ruff, Mario B. Ferrari and Robert C. Farenhem,
each a vice president and director own 21%, 12.5% and 12.5%, respectively, in
the general partner of Royal Palm Capital Management. This arrangement is being
agreed to by Royal Palm Capital Management for our benefit and is not intended
to provide Messrs. Rochon, Ruzika, Ruff, Ferrari and Farenhem compensation in
lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in
the Boca Raton area, that the fee charged by Royal Palm Capital Management is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $1,000,000. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $380,000) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $75,000), with the balance of
$305,000 being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and
other expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates and for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our
existing stockholder, officers and directors in connection with activities on
our behalf. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion of
the funds not being placed in trust to engage consultants to assist us with our
search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds not being
placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a provision
in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from shopping around for
transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such target
business) with respect to a particular proposed business combination, although
we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into such a letter
of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a target
business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop”
provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific business
combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of
such funds (whether as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our
not having sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due
diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account and other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

Royal Palm Capital Management, LLLP, an affiliate of our officers and directors,
has advanced to us a total of $75,000 which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal and audit fees and expenses.
The loan will be payable without interest on the earlier of June 1, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in
United States “government securities” or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. The income derived from investment of these net proceeds during
this period will be used to defray our general and administrative expenses, as
well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and regulations,
including associated professional fees, until a business combination is
completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficiently
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the report by
Eisner LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm, contains a going
concern qualification.

Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation of
the acquisition of the target business, we will pay Royal Palm Capital
Management, LLLP the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting
or other similar fees) will be paid to our existing stockholder or to any of our
officers and directors, or any of their respective affiliates, for services
rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business
combination. However, our existing stockholder and our officers and directors
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since
the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we
have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if such stockholder converts such shares into
cash in connection with a business combination which the public stockholder (but
not our existing stockholder, nor any of our officers and directors to the
extent that they receive shares upon distribution from the existing stockholder
or purchase any shares in this offering or the aftermarket) voted against and
which we consummate. Under no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

discounts, commissions and estimated offering expenses from the sale of the
common stock are estimated to be approximately $14.1 million. If the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate our net
proceeds from the offering will be approximately $16.8 million. We currently
intend to use the proceeds of this offering as follows:

    •    approximately $2.8 million to complete our two concurrent Phase III       
         clinical trials for SinuNase that we expect to commence in calendar year  
         2005;                                                                     

    •    approximately $6.1 million to fund milestone payments due to our          
         development partners over approximately the next 12 months with respect to
         the development of our specialty pharmaceutical products; and             

    •    the remaining proceeds for other general corporate purposes, including    
         working capital and capital expenditures. Specifically, we expect that we 
         will use approximately $4.9 million to fund operating losses and increases
         in working capital needs during the next 12 months.                       

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional businesses,
services, products, or technologies or invest in additional businesses that we
believe will complement our current or future business. However, we have no
specific plans, agreements, or commitments to do so and are not currently
engaged in any negotiations for any acquisition or investment, and we have not
identified the amounts of any funds to be used for this purpose.

The amounts and timing of our use of proceeds will vary depending on a number of
factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our operations, the
success of our product development efforts, competitive and technological
developments, and the rate of growth, if any, of our business. As of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot specify with certainty all of the particular uses for
the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the allocation of the
net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest
the net proceeds of this offering in cash, cash-equivalents, money market funds,
or short-term interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We cannot predict
whether the proceeds will be invested to yield a favorable return.

We do not currently intend to use any of the proceeds from this offering to fund
Biovest’s Phase III clinical trials for Biovaxid. Under our investment agreement
with Biovest, our remaining funding commitment to Biovest was $2.0 million as of
July 31, 2005, and we expect that this commitment will be entirely satisfied by
November 2005 with funds currently on hand. We anticipate that our funding to
Biovest will be sufficient to fund Biovest’s Phase III clinical trial for
Biovaxid for approximately the next six months. Accordingly, we anticipate that
Biovest will need to raise substantial additional capital in order to continue
the clinical trials for Biovaxid after the next six months, although we do not
currently intend to increase our investment commitment to Biovest for this
purpose. If Biovest raises additional funds through the issuance of equity
securities, we may experience dilution of our ownership interest in Biovest."

from our sale of 4,000,000 shares of common stock based on the initial public
offering price of $5.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses of approximately $3.5 million, which includes
our underwriter’s non-accountable expense allowance, legal, accounting, printing
costs and expenses, and various fees associated with the registration and
listing of our securities payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, we will receive an additional $2,790,000 after
deducting $210,000 for underwriting discounts and commissions.

in full, we expect to use the additional net proceeds that we receive, which
will be approximately $13.7 million in the aggregate, for general working
capital purposes, including potential future development and acquisitions. We do
not intend to use any of the net proceeds from the offering to fund
distributions to our stockholders, but to the extent we use the net proceeds to
fund distributions, these payments will be treated as a return of capital to our
stockholders for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

    The following table sets forth information, as of June 30, 2005, with
respect to the indebtedness we intend to repay with a portion of the net
proceeds from the offering.

common stock in this offering will be approximately $115.1 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated offering
expenses. We will not receive any of the proceeds from any sale of shares of our
common stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to
repay approximately $45.0 million of indebtedness outstanding under our new
$140.0 million senior secured term loan described below, together with accrued
and unpaid interest to the repayment date of approximately $0.3 million. We also
intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to pay the
purchase price of the eight liftboats from Danos & Curole of approximately $44.0
million. This offering is not conditioned on the closing of that acquisition,
which acquisition is subject to various closing conditions that may not be
satisfied. We intend to use the remaining net proceeds, including any proceeds
not used for the Danos acquisition if it fails to close, for other corporate
purposes, which may include the refurbishment of Rig 16 and Rig 31 and the
acquisition of additional rigs and liftboats.

In June 2005, we entered into a $140.0 million senior secured term loan. We used
the proceeds from the term loan to repay all outstanding amounts under two
credit facilities, including accrued interest, fees and applicable prepayment
premiums, to fund the purchase price of the jackup rig Rig 16 and for general
corporate purposes. We terminated both of those credit facilities in connection
with the repayment. Amounts outstanding under our new senior secured term loan
currently bear interest at either (1) the highest of (a) Comerica Bank’s base
rate, (b) the three-month certificate of deposit rate plus 0.5% and (c) the
Federal funds effective rate plus 0.5%, in each case plus 2.25%, or (2) LIBOR
plus 3.25%. As of June 30, 2005, amounts outstanding under the term loan bore
interest at 6.58%. In accordance with the credit agreement, in July 2005, we
entered into hedge transactions with the purpose and effect of fixing the
interest rate on $70.0 million of the outstanding principal amount of the term
loan at 7.54% for three years. In addition, we entered into hedge transactions
with the purpose and effect of capping the interest rate on an additional $20.0
million of such principal amount at 8.25% for three years. The term loan matures
in June 2010 and has quarterly principal payments in an amount equal to 1% per
annum."

stock in this offering will be approximately $21,105,000, or approximately
$24,453,000 if the underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full.

We intend to use these net proceeds approximately as follows:

          Research and development of our FPOA chips       $  7,400,000  
          Expansion of sales force and marketing efforts      5,700,000  
          Repayment of 8% convertible promissory notes        5,700,000  
          Repayment of bank line of credit                      400,000  
          Working capital                                     1,905,000

Of the net proceeds allocated to research and development of our FPOA chips,
approximately $2,200,000 will be used to fund an ongoing engineering project to
analyze the current design of the FPOA. With such proceeds, we expect to resolve
material design issues in the current chip and expect to produce, in the first
quarter of 2006, a chip that is expected to be fully functional at the intended
one GHz clock speed and that can be fabricated with a high enough manufacturing
yield to provide the expected gross margin, although there can be no assurance
that we can do so. To facilitate this effort, we will continue to purchase
additional design simulation software, add design engineers and re-assign
engineering priorities.

A portion of the proceeds will be used to repay the outstanding principal amount
of the 8% convertible promissory notes, up to $5,500,000, plus accrued interest,
which was $187,000 as of September 30, 2005. Interest accrues on the notes at an
annual rate of 8% and is payable at maturity. The notes are payable in full on
the earlier of 30 days after the closing date of an initial public offering,
including this offering or, if no public offering is effective before April
2006, in April 2006, subject to our right to extend the maturity date for up to
six months. The proceeds from the notes were used for research and development
of our FPOA chips, expansion of our sales force and marketing efforts and as
general working capital. The notes provide the note holders the option to
convert the principal amount plus accrued interest into common stock at a
beneficial conversion price equal to 80% of the price at which shares of common
stock are sold in an initial public offering or $4.80 if no such offering is
closed before the April 2006 maturity date of the notes or extension thereof.

Approximately $400,000 of the net proceeds will be used to pay all principal and
accrued interest to date on the revolving line of credit we obtained in October
2005 from a commercial bank. Interest accrues on the line of credit at an annual
rate of 4.72% and is payable monthly, beginning November 7, 2005. Principal and
accrued interest are payable at maturity on April 7, 2006. Payment of the line
of credit is secured by a pledge to the bank by Douglas M. Pihl, our President
and Chief Executive Officer, of a certificate of deposit in the principal amount
of $400,000.  Mr. Pihl is receiving no fees or other compensation for this
pledge. The proceeds from the revolving line of credit were used to pay
operating expenses.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the proceeds of this
offering in short- to medium-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
securities.

Although we expect to apply the net proceeds to the general categories in the
amounts indicated above, our management will continue to evaluate the
appropriate uses for our cash resources. We will make a proposed expenditure,
including a capital expenditure, only as business needs dictate after an
analysis of the costs and the benefits of the expenditure and an evaluation of
whether the expenditure will satisfy our business goals established by
management. Our management may change its plans in the future to allocate
resources away from uses that do not satisfy such business goals.

We believe that the proceeds of this offering, combined with our existing
capital resources, will be sufficient to support our operations for at least 12
months following the closing of this offering."

overallotment option is exercised in full, we estimate the net proceeds will be
approximately $57.1 million.

      We currently estimate that of the net proceeds of this offering we will
spend:
     •     approximately $23 million to finance working capital needs, including
           investment in System One field equipment and in sales and marketing  
           programs, including hiring additional personnel;

——————

(1)A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
from Mr. Nordlicht described below. These funds will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this
offering.

(2) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
these items may differ substantially from those set forth herein.

(3)Such amount is expected to be paid to legal, accounting and other outside
professional firms to conduct due diligence once a potential target business for
a business combination is identified and to assist in negotiating, structuring
and documenting the ultimate business combination and the preparation and filing
of the related proxy statement.

(4)Such amount represents expenses expected to be incurred by us and our officers
and directors in identifying and reviewing potential target businesses for
business combinations, which may include fees to market research firms or third
party consultants.

$105,408,000, or $121,219,200 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at HSBC
Bank USA maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, as trustee.  The proceeds held in trust will be invested only in United
States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the
United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds held in trust
will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the completion of
a business combination or our liquidation.  The proceeds held in the trust fund
may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which
we ultimately complete a business combination.  Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target business may be used to finance
operations of the target business and to fund payments of finder’s fees or
professional fees or payments of any fees or costs incurred in connection with
any debt or equity financing made in connection with the business
combination.  In addition, to the extent that the funds not held in the trust
fund are insufficient to cover the expenses of a business combination, such
expenses would be paid out of the proceeds held in the trust fund which are
released to us upon the consummation of a business combination.  In addition, it
is possible that our directors, officers and/or existing stockholders could
advance us the additional required funds prior to the business combination,
thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that might be
reimbursed following a business combination.  While it is difficult to determine
what the specific operating expenses of a target business may entail following
the business combination, we expect that they may include some or all of the
following: capital expenditures, expenditures for future projects, general
ongoing expenses including supplies and payroll, expanding markets and strategic
acquisitions or alliances.  

The payment to Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage, L.P., an affiliate of Mark
Nordlicht, our chairman of the board, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general
and administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Platinum Partners Value
Arbitrage, L.P. for our benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Nordlicht
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for
similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by
Platinum Partners Value Arbitrage, L.P. is at least as favorable as we could
have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay these
monthly fees.

We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $358,000 or $790,000
if the over-allotment option is exercised in full) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $100,000), with the balance of
$258,000 or $690,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, being
held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses
of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our estimates, as
well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses, including travel
expenses, incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on
our behalf as described below.  

We intend to allocate approximately $100,000 of the proceeds not held in trust
for expenses incurred in examining and evaluating prospective target businesses.
We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed
by some or all of our officers and directors and may also include engaging
market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our officers and directors
will not receive any compensation for their due diligence of prospective target
businesses, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as
travel expenses or expenses incurred for payments to third parties for their
performance of due diligence) incurred in connection with such due diligence
activities.  We could also use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust
to pay fees to market research firms or third party consultants to assist us
with our search of a target business.  These reimbursements and payments to
non-affiliated third parties that assist us with our search for a target
business may be paid from the $100,000 allocated for due diligence.

In addition, it is also possible that we could use a portion of the funds not in
the trust account to pay finders fees, consulting fees or other similar
compensation, or make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with
respect to a particular proposed business combination, although we do not have
any current intention to do so.  In the event that we were ultimately required
to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of our breach of the agreement
relating to such payment or otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of
working capital available outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence
and pay other expenses related to finding a suitable business combination
without securing additional financing.  If we were unable to secure additional
financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the
allotted time and would be forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business, which may include subsequent acquisitions,
and may also be used for payments of any finder’s fees or professional fees or
payments of any fees or costs incurred in connection with any debt or equity
financing made in connection with the business combination.

As of the date of this prospectus, Mark Nordlicht, our chairman of the board,
has advanced to us a total of $180,000, including $5,000 advanced on August 29,
2005, which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD registration
fee and legal fees and expenses.  The loans will be payable with 4% interest on
the earlier of May 5, 2006 or the consummation of this offering.  The loans will
be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act.  The interest income derived from investment of these
net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described herein
and reimbursement for out-of-pocket expenses described herein, no compensation
of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be paid to any of our
existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for services rendered to us
prior to or in connection with the consummation of the business combination,
including for the performance of due diligence.  However, our existing
stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business
combinations.  Any such reimbursements would come out of the proceeds not in the
trust fund.  To the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not
deposited in the trust fund, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed
by us unless we consummate a business combination.  If a business combination is
not consummated, the funds held in trust would be returned to investors without
any deductions for such out-of-pocket expenses.  Since the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate.  In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust fund."

——————

(1) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we received
from Messrs. Davidson and Toledano described below. These funds will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation
of this offering.

(2) Consists of an underwriting discount of 5% of the gross proceeds of the offering
(including any units sold to cover over-allotments). Does not include an
additional underwriting discount in the amount of 1.75% of the gross proceeds of
this offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments), payable out
of the funds held in trust upon consummation of a business combination.

(3) The 1.25% non-accountable expense allowance is not payable with respect to the
units sold upon exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment option.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
these items may differ substantially from those set forth herein.

$43,495,000, or $50,260,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at JPMorgan
Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New
York, New York, as trustee. The proceeds held in trust will be invested only in
United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under
the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds held in trust 
will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the completion 
of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust 
fund may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with 
which we ultimately complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as 
consideration to the sellers of the target business will be used to pay the 
additional underwriting discount to Maxim Group LLC as described below and the 
remainder may be used to finance operations of the target business.

We will pay up to $7,500 for general and administrative services, including
office space, utilities and secretarial support, to Millennium 3 Capital, Inc.,
an affiliate of Udi Toledano, our president and a member of our board of
directors, but in no event will such fees be more than $7,500 in the aggregate
and all such arrangements will be arm’s-length transactions. This arrangement
will be agreed to for our benefit and will not be intended to provide
Mr. Toledano compensation in lieu of a salary. Upon completion of a business
combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay these
monthly fees.

We intend to use the excess working capital of approximately $470,000, or
$545,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $120,000), with the balance
of $350,000, or $425,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses
will be performed by some or all of our officers, directors and advisors and may
also include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our
officers, directors and advisors will not receive any compensation for their due
diligence of prospective target businesses, but would be reimbursed for any
out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with
such due diligence activities. We believe that the excess working capital will
be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs.

However, it is also possible, as is common in acquisitions of hospitality assets
or companies, that we could use a portion of the funds not in the trust account
to make a deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a
particular proposed business combination. In the event that any such deposit or
down payment were large enough (thereby depleting enough of our non-trust fund
assets) or in the event we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or
otherwise), we may not have a sufficient amount of working capital available
outside of the trust account to conduct due diligence and pay other expenses
related to finding a suitable business combination without securing additional
financing. Although not obligated to do so, it is possible that our existing
stockholders could advance us the additional required funds, thereby increasing
the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses that could be reimbursed following a
business combination. If we were unable to secure additional financing, we would
most likely fail to consummate a business combination in the allotted time and
would be forced to liquidate.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to pay the
additional underwriting discount to Maxim Group LLC as described below and to
finance the operations of the target business.

Upon consummation of a business combination, the underwriters will be paid an
additional underwriting discount in the amount of 1.75% of the gross proceeds of
this offering (including any units sold to cover over-allotments) out of the
funds held in trust. Such additional amounts payable to the underwriters would
not be affected by any amounts depleted from the trust fund due to stockholders
voting against the business combination and exercising their conversion rights
into their pro rata portion of the trust fund. We believe that placing a portion
of the underwriting discount into the trust account which will be payable only
upon consummation of a business combination demonstrates confidence in our
ability to consummate a business combination and further aligns the
underwriters’ interests with those of our investors by having a portion of their
compensation be at risk in the event that we are unable to consummate a business
combination.  However, we have not engaged, nor are we under any contractual
obligation to engage, any underwriter to provide any services for us after this
offering, including assisting us in searching for and consummating a suitable
business combination.

As of the date of this prospectus, Messrs. Davidson and Toledano have advanced
to us a total of $145,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of
this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD
registration fee and legal fees and expenses. To date, we have paid out of such
loaned funds and our initial capital contributions from our existing
stockholders approximately $135,000 for expenses relating to this offering and
approximately $10,000 of such loaned funds remains outstanding. Of such loans,
$115,000 will be payable without interest on the earlier of May 2, 2006 or the
consummation of this offering and $30,000 will be payable without interest on 
the earlier of August 3, 2006 or the consummation of the offering. The loans 
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not immediately
required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States
“government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued by the United
States having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act
of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the
Investment Company Act. The interest income derived from investment of these net
proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

Other than the $7,500 aggregate per month administrative fees described above,
no compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, for
services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of the
business combination. However, our existing stockholders will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and
performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. Since the role of
present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability
to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust fund
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust fund, net of
taxes payable, which taxes, if any, shall be paid from the trust fund) only in
the event of our liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination
within the allotted time or if that public stockholder were to seek to convert
such shares into cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust fund."

$45,050,000, or $52,164,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination.

The payment to Paramount BioCapital Asset Management, an affiliate of our
executive officers, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. 
This arrangement is being agreed to by Paramount BioCapital Asset Management 
for our benefit and is not intended to provide our executive officers 
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees
for similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by Paramount BioCapital Asset Management is at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's, consulting
or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors,
stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination.
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us
out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to ""Legal, accounting
and other expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring
and negotiation of a business combination,"" ""Due diligence of prospective target
businesses"" and ""Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance,
taxes and reserves."" Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $1,370,000. We intend to use the
excess working capital (approximately $550,000) for director and officer
liability insurance premiums (approximately $90,000), with the balance of
$460,000 being held in reserve for tax payments and in the event due diligence,
legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business
combinations exceed our estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with
activities on our behalf as described below. We believe that the excess working
capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement
costs. We could use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees
to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business. We could also
use a portion of the funds not being placed in trust as a down payment or to
fund a ""no-shop"" provision (a provision in letters of intent designed to keep
target businesses from ""shopping"" around for transactions with other companies
on terms more favorable to such target businesses) with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. If we did use a portion of the funds in this manner, the amount that
would be used as a down payment or to fund a ""no-shop"" provision would be
determined based on the terms of the specific business combination and the
amount of our available funds at the time. Our forfeiture of such funds (whether
as a result of our breach or otherwise) could result in our not having
sufficient funds to continue searching for, or conducting due diligence with
respect to, potential target businesses.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in ""government securities"" or in money
market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The income derived from the investment
of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business.

Lindsay A. Rosenwald has advanced to us a total of $100,000 which was used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and
legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on
the earlier of December 1, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our
existing stockholders) converts such shares into cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

$45,050,000, or $52,164,500 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman Brothers Inc.,
maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as
trustee. The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States
""government securities"" within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment
Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from
the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination
or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a
business combination.

The payment to Paramount BioCapital Asset Management, an affiliate of our
executive officers, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. 
This arrangement is being agreed to by Paramount BioCapital Asset Management 
for our benefit and is not intended to provide our executive officers 
compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and fees
for similar services in the New York City metropolitan area, that the fee
charged by Paramount BioCapital Asset Management is at least as favorable as we
could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This arrangement will terminate
upon completion of a business combination or the distribution of the trust
account to our public stockholders. Other than the $7,500 per month
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finder's, consulting
or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors,
stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they
render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination.
However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as
identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on
suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as traveling to and
from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses
to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us
out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to ""Legal, accounting
and other expenses attendant to the due diligence investigations, structuring
and negotiation of a business combination,"" ""Due diligence of prospective target
businesses"" and ""Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance,
taxes and reserves."" Since the role of present management after a business
combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if
any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in
full, the net proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a
business combination will be approximately $1,370,000. We intend to use the

laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business.

Lindsay A. Rosenwald has advanced to us a total of $100,000 which was used to
pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items
above for SEC registration fee, NASD filing fee and
legal and audit fees and expenses. The loan will be payable without interest on
the earlier of December 1, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loan
will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our
existing stockholders) converts such shares into cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

million after deducting the estimated expenses related to this offering and the
underwriting discounts. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive to pay off
all of the principal and accrued interest then outstanding under our credit
facility, which includes amounts incurred in connection with our acquisition of
SES and for the distribution of previously undistributed S corporation earnings.
On June 30, 2005, that amount was $21.8 million, approximately $10.1 million of
which was under a term note and $11.7 million of which was under a line of
credit. In July 2005, the credit facility was amended to allow for a new time
loan under which we borrowed $15 million and an additional $3 million under our
line of credit, for distribution of previously undistributed S corporation
earnings. Our term note and line of credit mature on December 31, 2006, and
accrue interest based on LIBOR plus an applicable margin. The time loan will be
due in January 2006, or upon receipt of proceeds from this offering, whichever
occurs first. As of June 30, 2005, interest on our term note and line of credit
was based on LIBOR plus 2.7% and 2.2%, respectively. Both margins are based on
the ratio of our funded indebtedness to our adjusted earnings. The weighted
average interest rate applicable to all borrowings under our credit facility was
approximately 5.5% on June 30, 2005. The interest rate on the time loan is LIBOR
plus 45 basis points. After the repayment of the line of credit, we may re-incur
debt under the revolving note.

We may use some or all of the remaining net proceeds from this offering for
working capital and general corporate purposes, including all or a portion of
the costs of any acquisitions we decide to pursue in the future. We have no
present commitments, agreements or understandings to acquire any business.
Pending final use, we may invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities or guaranteed
obligations of the United States or its agencies.

We will not receive any of the proceeds from sale of Class A common stock by the
selling stockholders."

(1)
   º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Joel R. Jacks and Peter M. Schulte, as described below. These
     funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon consummation
     of this offering.

(2)
   º Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of our existing
     stockholders for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
     offering.

(3)
   º The amount of proceeds not held in trust remains constant if the
     over-allotment option is exercised.

    We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire an
operating business in the federal services and defense industries.

    Of the net proceeds, $117,180,000, or $135,135,000 if the underwriter's
over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will
be used to pay the underwriter an additional fee equal to 2% of the gross
proceeds of this offering upon the consummation of our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

    We have agreed to pay CM Equity Management, L.P., an affiliate of Messrs.
Jacks and Schulte, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York, New York
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by CM Equity Management, L.P. is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.

    Two million dollars of the net proceeds, regardless of whether the
underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised, will not be placed in trust
and will be available for our use. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $740,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $200,000), with the balance of $540,000 being held in reserve for
other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination, as well as
for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging market
research and valuation firms, as well as other third-party consultants. Our
existing stockholders, directors, officers and their affiliates, will not
receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while
performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. We believe that the
excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

    As of the date of the prospectus, Joel R. Jacks and Peter M. Schulte have
loaned a total of $154,000 to us for payment of offering expenses on our behalf.
The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of April 18, 2006 or
the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds
of this offering used for the payment of offering expenses.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States ""government
securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States having a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we
are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The interest income derived from investment of the net proceeds not held
in trust during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the amount of available
proceeds will be sufficient to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the
report of Eisner LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
contains a going concern qualification. The amount of available proceeds is
based on management's estimates of the costs needed to fund our operations for
the next 24 months and consummate a business combination. Those estimates may
prove inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to
make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a
business combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available
proceeds in pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do
not have sufficient proceeds available to fund our expenses, we may be forced to
obtain additional financing, either from our management or the existing
stockholders or from third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional
financing and our existing stockholders and management are not obligated to
provide any additional financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds and
cannot find additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to
consummating a business combination.

    Other than the $7,500 monthly fee payable to CM Equity Management, L.P. in
connection with the general and administrative services arrangement, no
compensation of any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid to
any of our existing stockholders, officers or directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders,
officers, directors and their affiliates, will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Because the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable) only in the event of our liquidation upon our
failure to complete a business combination within 18 months after consummation
of this offering (or within 24 months after the consummation of this offering if
a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement has been
executed within 18 months after consummation of this offering and the business
combination relating thereto has not yet been consummated within such 18-month
period) or if that public stockholder were to convert shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

    Our existing stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account with respect to any shares of common stock which they purchased in or
following this offering, but only in the event of our liquidation as described
above."

liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will
be used to pay the underwriter an additional fee equal to 2% of the gross
proceeds of this offering upon the consummation of our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

    We have agreed to pay CM Equity Management, L.P., an affiliate of Messrs.
Jacks and Schulte, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York, New York
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by CM Equity Management, L.P. is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.

    Two million dollars of the net proceeds, regardless of whether the
underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised, will not be placed in trust
and will be available for our use. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $740,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $200,000), with the balance of $540,000 being held in reserve for
other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination, as well as
for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging market
research and valuation firms, as well as other third-party consultants. Our
existing stockholders, directors, officers and their affiliates, will not
receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while
performing due diligence of prospective target businesses. We believe that the
excess working capital will be sufficient to cover the foregoing expenses and
reimbursement costs.

    We may not use all of the proceeds in the trust in connection with a
business combination, either because the consideration for the business
combination is less than the proceeds in trust or because we finance a portion
of the consideration with our capital stock or debt securities. In that event,
the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not
expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business, which
may include subsequent acquisitions.

    As of the date of the prospectus, Joel R. Jacks and Peter M. Schulte have
loaned a total of $154,000 to us for payment of offering expenses on our behalf.
The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of April 18, 2006 or
the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds
of this offering used for the payment of offering expenses.

    The net proceeds of this offering that are not immediately required for the
purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States ""government
securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by the United States having a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we
are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act of
1940. The interest income derived from investment of the net proceeds not held
in trust during this period will be used to defray our general and
administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities
laws and regulations, including associated professional fees, until a business
combination is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, the amount of available
proceeds will be sufficient to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming
that a business combination is not consummated during that time. However, the
report of Eisner LLP, our independent registered public accounting firm,
contains a going concern qualification. The amount of available proceeds is
based on management's estimates of the costs needed to fund our operations for
the next 24 months and consummate a business combination. Those estimates may
prove inaccurate, especially if a portion of the available proceeds is used to
make a down payment or pay exclusivity or similar fees in connection with a
business combination or if we expend a significant portion of the available
proceeds in pursuit of a business combination that is not consummated. If we do
not have sufficient proceeds available to fund our expenses, we may be forced to
obtain additional financing, either from our management or the existing
stockholders or from third parties. We may not be able to obtain additional
financing and our existing stockholders and management are not obligated to
provide any additional financing. If we do not have sufficient proceeds and
cannot find additional financing, we may be forced to liquidate prior to
consummating a business combination.

    Other than the $7,500 monthly fee payable to CM Equity Management, L.P. in
connection with the general and administrative services arrangement, no
compensation of any kind (including finders and consulting fees) will be paid to
any of our existing stockholders, officers or directors, or any of their
affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the
consummation of the business combination. However, our existing stockholders,
officers, directors and their affiliates, will receive reimbursement for any
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due
diligence on suitable business combinations. Because the role of present
management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to
determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a
business combination.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account, net of taxes payable) only in the event of our liquidation upon our
failure to complete a business combination within 18 months after consummation
of this offering (or within 24 months after the consummation of this offering if
a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement has been
executed within 18 months after consummation of this offering and the business
combination relating thereto has not yet been consummated within such 18-month
period) or if that public stockholder were to convert shares into cash in
connection with a business combination which the public stockholder voted
against and which we actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

    Our existing stockholders will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account with respect to any shares of common stock which they purchased in or
following this offering, but only in the event of our liquidation as described
above."

(1)
   º A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the funds we
     received from Joel R. Jacks and Peter M. Schulte, as described below. These
     funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering upon consummation
     of this offering.

(2)
   º Miscellaneous expenses include the reimbursement of our existing
     stockholders for out-of-pocket expenses incurred in connection with the
     offering.

(3)
   º The amount of proceeds not held in trust remains constant if the
     over-allotment option is exercised.

    We intend to use the proceeds from the sale of the units to acquire an
operating business in the federal services and defense industries.

    Of the net proceeds, $117,180,000, or $135,135,000 if the underwriter's
over-allotment option is exercised in full, will be placed in a trust account at
JPMorgan Chase NY Bank maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account
until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our
liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration
to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete a
business combination. Additionally, the proceeds held in the trust account will
be used to pay the underwriter an additional fee equal to 2% of the gross
proceeds of this offering upon the consummation of our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

    We have agreed to pay CM Equity Management, L.P., an affiliate of Messrs.
Jacks and Schulte, a monthly fee of $7,500 for general and administrative
services including office space, utilities and secretarial support. We believe,
based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York, New York
metropolitan area, that the fee charged by CM Equity Management, L.P. is at
least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated third party.

    Two million dollars of the net proceeds, regardless of whether the
underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised, will not be placed in trust
and will be available for our use. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $740,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $200,000), with the balance of $540,000 being held in reserve for
other expenses of structuring and negotiating a business combination, as well as
for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our existing
stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We
expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by
some or all of our officers and directors, and may include engaging market
research and valuation firms, as well as other third-party consultants. Our
existing stockholders, directors, officers and their affiliates, will not
receive any compensation for their due diligence efforts, other than
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses they may incur on our behalf while

about $146.3 million. If the underwriters fully exercise their over-allotment
option, our net proceeds from the offering will be about $170.4 million. Net
proceeds are what we expect to receive after paying underwriting discounts and
commissions and our estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any
proceeds from the sale of shares of Class A common stock by the selling
stockholders in this offering.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, create
a public market for our Class A common stock, facilitate our future access to
public equity markets and provide increased visibility in a marketplace in which
a number of our current and potential competitors are or will be publicly held
companies. While, at this time, we have no specific allocations for the use of
proceeds from this offering, we intend to use the net proceeds primarily for
general corporate purposes, including for development of our technology
infrastructure, capital expenditures and working capital. We also may use a
portion of the proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses, technologies,
products or services, although no specific acquisitions are currently planned
and no portion of the net proceeds has been allocated for any acquisition. Our
management will have broad discretion over how we use the net proceeds from this
offering. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities."

$19.63 million, after deducting approximately $2.37 million in underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
Underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in full, then we estimate that
the net proceeds to us from this offering will be approximately $22.65 million.

We intend to use approximately $2.5 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to continue the development of the PokerPro ™ system and approximately
$3.0 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pursue regulatory
approvals. To continue the development of the PokerPro™ system, we intend to
complete the development and testing of the software that will allow additional
poker games that may be played on the PokerPro™ system, as well as enhance the
PokerPro™ system’s player tracking and accounting system. We will use the
remaining proceeds for general working capital purposes.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the amounts that we will
actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amount and timing of actual
expenditures may vary significantly, depending on a number of factors, such as
the speed with which the market accepts the PokerPro™ system, the progress of
our intellectual property development, our success in obtaining necessary
regulatory approvals and the amount of cash used by operations. If the market
accepts the PokerPro ™ system more quickly than we expect, we could use more of
the proceeds from this offering to manufacture PokerPro™ systems and less on
pursuing regulatory approvals in new jurisdictions. If we encounter difficulty
in obtaining necessary regulatory approvals, we would have to allocate more of
such proceeds to obtaining such approvals and less on the manufacture of
PokerPro™systems. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility
in applying the net proceeds from this offering. Until we use the net proceeds
of the offering, we intend to invest them in short term, interest-bearing
securities."

estimated debt issuance costs of approximately $1.6 million) and 13,999,900

form of our common stock. However, the aggregate book value of the vessels that
we record on our balance sheet as of the completion of this offering will be
equal to OSG's historical aggregate book value in the vessels, or $347.6 million
at June 30, 2005. We will treat the $233.0 million excess of the purchase price
over the book value of the vessels as a deemed distribution to OSG.

                  interest due on our senior unsecured credit agreement which is 
                  estimated to be approximately $286.8 million as of September   
                  30, 2005; and                                                  
                                          
            *     to pay all accrued and unpaid dividends on our Series A 12.0%  
                  cumulative senior preferred stock which are estimated to be    
                  approximately $22.5 million as of September 30, 2005.          

Our senior unsecured credit agreement matures on November 2, 2014 and bears
interest at an interest rate which increases by 0.25% per annum each 90-day
period following the Acquisition, up to a maximum interest rate of 11.5% per
annum. As of June 30, 2005, the interest rate on a cash basis under our senior
unsecured credit agreement was 9.25%, although we are accruing for interest on a
level rate basis of 11.08% since we are assuming that the balance will remain
outstanding until the final contractual maturity of the facility. The proceeds 
of our senior unsecured credit facility were used in November 2004 to fund a 
portion of the purchase price paid by us in connection with the Acquisition. 

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of our common stock, if any, by
the selling stockholders upon the exercise of the underwriters' over-allotment
option."

in estimated net proceeds of $443.3 million, we intend to distribute the net
proceeds as follows:

  •    $221.6 million (50% of the net proceeds) will be contributed to Investors   
       Savings Bank;

  •    $184.6 million (41.65% of the net proceeds) will be retained by us.         

   We may use the net proceeds of the offering to invest in securities, to
deposit funds in Investors Savings Bank, to finance the possible acquisition of
other financial institutions or financial service businesses, to pay dividends
or for other general corporate purposes, including repurchasing shares of our
common stock. Investors Savings Bank may use the proceeds it receives to make

are selling in this offering will be approximately $143.6 million (of which
approximately $6.7 million will be paid as a prepayment premium in connection
with the retirement of indebtedness as described below), based on our public
offering price of $21.00 per share.

      We currently anticipate that we will use our net proceeds to repay
approximately $70 million of indebtedness under our 2015 Senior Notes and
approximately $66.9 million of indebtedness outstanding under our asset based
revolver. The 2015 Senior Notes proceeds and the borrowings under our asset
based revolver were initially used to pay off the remaining balances on our
then-existing senior secured term loan and junior secured term loan. The 2015
Senior Notes bear interest at a rate of 91/2% per annum and are the general,
unsecured senior obligations of American Commercial Lines LLC (“ACL LLC”) and
ACL Finance Corp. The asset based revolver has a five-year term, maturing
February 11, 2010, and bears interest at LIBOR plus a margin (2.25% as of
June 30, 2005) based upon the amount of unused availability under the facility.

      The remainder of the proceeds from this offering will be used to pay a
prepayment premium under the 2015 Senior Notes, as well as fees and expenses
related to this offering. The prepayment premium of $6.7 million will be
expensed in 2005. The other fees and expenses related to this offering will be
treated as a reduction of other capital, thereby reducing the amount of equity
recognized from the proceeds of this offering. We are electing to redeem a
portion of the 2015 Senior Notes and incur the prepayment premium because we
believe the premium is economically justified by the interest savings. In the
future, we expect to reborrow under our asset based revolver in order to
reinvest in our barge fleet and to take advantage of market opportunities.
Please see the section of the prospectus entitled “Description of Certain
Indebtedness and Security Arrangements” for additional information relating to
our indebtedness.

      We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of common shares by
the selling stockholder."

deducting the underwriting discount and the estimated expenses related to this
offering. We intend to use $100.15 million of the net proceeds of this offering,
together with indebtedness of $9.75 million under a new credit facility that we
intend to obtain, to acquire the Identified Vessels, other than the Gas
Sincerity. The balance of the net proceeds of this offering, in the amount of
$7.14 million, will be used for working capital and other corporate purposes,
including acquisitions of other vessels that we have not yet identified.

We have entered into agreements with the Vafias Group pursuant to which we will
pay $109.9 million to acquire the Identified Vessels from the Vafias Group,
other than the Gas Sincerity. The aggregate purchase price of $109.9 million
represents the fair market value of these nine Identified Vessels at the time we
agreed to acquire them. We will acquire the Gas Prodigy, the Gas Oracle, the
Sweet Dream, the Gas Chios and the Gas Catharthrough the acquisition of the
capital stock of their owners, which are Vafias Group affiliates. The owners'
current bank debt will be repaid. We expect the deliveries of the Identified
Vessels to occur between the closing of this offering and the end of November
2005, other than with respect to the Gas Eternity, which we expect will be
delivered by February 2006. The delivery of each of the Identified Vessels is
subject to customary conditions.

We intend to incur the indebtedness of $9.75 million to finance a portion of the
purchase price for the Marathon under a new credit facility, which would be
secured by a security interest in the Marathon. We have had preliminary
discussions with potential lenders, although we cannot assure you that we will
obtain such financing. If we are unable to obtain a new credit facility to fund
the $9.75 million portion of the purchase price for the Marathon, we intend to
fund that portion of the acquisition from other sources, which may include a
capital contribution from our current sole stockholder or cash on hand. We
intend to fund the $15.1 million acquisition price for the Gas Sincerity with
$9.75 million in additional indebtedness under a new credit facility, which
would be secured by a security interest in the Gas Sincerity, we intend to
obtain, together with $5.35 million of cash from operations.

If we do not purchase any of these nine Identified Vessels, we may use the
proceeds of this offering to purchase other vessels or for general corporate
purposes. In particular, certain events may arise which could result in us not
taking delivery of any of these nine Identified Vessels, such as a total loss of
a vessel, a constructive total loss of a vessel, or substantial damage to a
vessel prior to its delivery."

    The net proceeds may vary because total expenses relating to the offering
may be more or less than our estimates. For example, our expenses would increase
if a syndicated community offering were used to sell shares of common stock not
purchased in the subscription offering and any community offering. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts are not shown
above and will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment, but will
result in a reduction of Wauwatosa Savings’ deposits. The Wauwatosa Holdings
business plan assumes that 20% of the offering is purchased by funds on deposit
at Wauwatosa Savings.

    We are undertaking the offering at this time in order to increase our
capital and have the capital resources available to expand and diversify our
business. For further information, see “BUSINESS OF WAUWATOSA SAVINGS BANK —
Business Strategy” on page 54. The offering proceeds will increase our capital
resources and the amount of funds available to us for lending and investment
purposes. The proceeds will also give us greater flexibility to diversify
operations and expand our branch network and the products and services we offer
to our customers.

Wauwatosa Holdings may use the proceeds it retains from the offering:

    (1) to finance the purchase of common stock in the offering by our employee
stock ownership plan (see table above);
    (2) to invest in securities;
    (3) to repurchase its shares of common stock;
    (4) to finance acquisitions of financial institutions and other financial
services businesses, although no specific acquisition transactions are being
considered at this time; and
    (5) for general corporate purposes.

    Most of the proceeds retained by Wauwatosa Holdings will initially be
invested in securities or instruments of varying terms in order to maximize
returns pending redeployment of resources as noted in items 3 through 5 above.
The loan that will be used to fund the purchases by the employee stock ownership
plan will accrue interest.

Wauwatosa Savings may use the proceeds it receives from the offering:
    (1) to expand our branch network and otherwise expand our retail banking
franchise;
    (2) to fund new loans and otherwise increase our loan portfolio;
    (3) to support new products and services;
    (4) to invest in securities; and
    (5) for general corporate purposes.

    While the cost of expanding our banking franchise via product development
and marketing is difficult to determine, management estimates that the capital
investment required for each de novo branch to range from $1.5 million to
$4.5 million. The proceeds retained by Wauwatosa Savings will initially be
invested in securities or instruments of varying terms in order to maximize
returns pending redeployment of resources as noted in items 1, 2, 3, and 5
above.

    The use of the proceeds outlined above may change based on changes in
interest rates, equity markets, laws and regulations affecting the financial
services industry, our relative position in the financial services industry, the
attractiveness of potential acquisitions or other opportunities to expand our
operations, and overall market conditions."

corporate headquarters in Zhuhai. We may also use a smaller portion of the
proceeds to establish offices in other cities in China, such as Beijing or
Shanghai. We have not, however, made any specific expenditure plans with respect
to the net proceeds of this offering, and have not allocated any specific
portion of the net proceeds of this offering for any particular purpose. As a

offered by the Company hereby is approximately $116.3 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $19.00 per share, after deducting the estimated

expect to use the net proceeds for repayment of certain of our outstanding
indebtedness as described below, acquisition of additional senior living
operating companies and facilities, including the acquisition of six facilities
pursuant to a purchase option as described below, and other general corporate
purposes. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term
interest-bearing instruments or money market accounts.

offering towards the purchase price of approximately $19.4 million (net of a
$1.0 million lease deposit and excluding closing costs) to exercise our purchase
option with respect to six facilities that Alterra currently leases from Omega
Healthcare Investors, Inc. and certain of its affiliates. We expect to raise an
additional $13.0 million of debt to fund the remainder of the purchase price and
closing costs. Upon our exercise of the purchase option, the leases and all
other related agreements effecting these properties will be terminated.

    We intend to use approximately $60.7 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the following indebtedness and $2.2 million of the following
lessor advances:

    •  Approximately $7.8 million to repay in full the debt outstanding under a    
       first mortgage loan encumbering our Westbury Care Center facility. The loan 
       bears interest at the rate of prime plus 0.75% and is due March 31, 2008.   
       The loan can be prepaid without penalty.                                    
   
    •  Approximately $32.0 million to repay the notes B portion of our             
       $182.0 million first mortgage loan entered into in March 2005 with Guaranty 
       Bank, which is secured by five facilities located in Illinois, North        
       Carolina, Missouri, Ohio and New York. BLC used the proceeds of the loan to 
       refinance the existing indebtedness on these five facilities, including     
       repayment in full of a first mortgage loan and a mezzanine loan encumbering 
       The Hallmark at Battery Park City in the amount of $50.0 million and        
       $8.5 million, respectively. The notes B can be prepaid, subject to a        
       prepayment fee equal to 1% of the principal being repaid. The loan matures  
       on April 1, 2008, and may be extended for two additional one-year periods,  
       subject to certain covenants. The $182.0 million loan is allocated between  
       $150.0 million in notes A, which bear interest at LIBOR plus 3.05%, and     
       $32.0 million in notes B, which bear interest at LIBOR plus 5.60%. At the   
       end of the 12th and 24th calendar months, the notes B can be resized to     
       notes A, in which case the notes A interest rate increases to LIBOR plus    
       3.10%. If the borrowers do not meet certain debt coverage ratios or facility
       occupancy ratios during the first year of the loan, the Notes B interest    
       rate increases to LIBOR plus 6.60%. If the ratios remain unmet from and     
       after the second year of the loan, the Notes B interest rate increases to   
       LIBOR plus 7.60%.                                                           
   
    •  Approximately $9.5 million to repay in full our term loan from LaSalle Bank 
       National Association that is payable interest only monthly at the rate of   
       prime plus 1.00% and the principal of which is due in quarterly installments
       of $0.5 million commencing July 1, 2005 until maturity on March 31, 2007.   
       The loan can be prepaid without penalty.                                    
   
    •  Approximately $2.5 million to repay in full the debt outstanding related to 
       Assisted Living Residence Revenue Bonds encumbering four Alterra facilities 
       located in Kansas. The bonds have an average interest rate of 7.36% and     
       mature in 2009. The bonds may be prepaid at 102% of the outstanding         
       principal balance plus accrued and unpaid interest.                         
   
    •  Approximately $8.9 million to repay unsecured notes that were issued in     
       conjunction with Alterra’s acquisition of joint venture partnership         
       interests. The notes bear interest at 9.00% and mature in December 2008. The
       notes may be prepaid without penalty, upon five days’ notice.               

    •  Approximately $2.2 million to repay in full lessor advances to fund certain 
       escrow deposits and costs in connection with the Chambrel Portfolio, which  
       amount can be repaid at any time during the term of the lease. The current  
       lease rate on this amount is 15.86%.

of $55.9 million after deducting the estimated underwriting discount and
offering expenses, which are payable by us. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
shareholders, including any proceeds from the selling shareholders’ sale of
additional shares upon exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares.

    The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital,
create a public market for our common stock, facilitate our future access to
public equity markets, enable us to provide incentives to our employees through
equity-linked compensation programs and provide increased visibility in the
market. Publicly tradable shares of our common stock may also be used as an
acquisition currency. On November 23, 2004, we borrowed the entire $25.0 million
available under our credit facility with Wachovia Bank, National Association to
fund a portion of the $67.5 million redemption of our Class B common stock. On
October 18, 2005, we entered into an amendment with Wachovia to increase the
amount available under our credit facility to $50.0 million. The borrowings
outstanding under the credit facility mature on November 17, 2007. We intend to
use a portion of the proceeds of this offering for the repayment in full of all
outstanding debt under this facility, which as of September 30, 2005, amounted
to $13.0 million, bearing interest at a 30-day LIBOR locked interest rate of
4.66%. We otherwise currently do not have specific plans for the use of the net
proceeds of the offering. We expect that we will use the net proceeds for
general corporate purposes, including expanding and diversifying our products
and services.

    We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary
businesses, products and technologies, although we have no current agreements or
commitments to do so. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds
of this offering in short-term money-market and money-market equivalent
securities."

underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses
payable by us and assuming no exercise of the underwriters’ over-allotment
option, will be approximately US$59.0 million. If the underwriters exercise
their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us
will be approximately US$71.1 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds
from the sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

The principal reasons for this offering are to create a public market for our
ordinary shares for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees
by providing them with equity incentives, promote our corporate brand image and
perceived creditworthiness with customers and suppliers, and raise capital. As
of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated any specific portion of
the net proceeds we expect to receive from this offering for any particular
purpose. We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for
general corporate purposes, including funding our working capital needs. We may
use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire businesses, products and
technologies that we believe will complement our business. We are not currently
engaged in any negotiations for an acquisition.

We have not yet determined all of our anticipated expenditures and therefore
cannot estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above.
The amounts and timing of any expenditure will vary depending on the amount of
cash generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and
the rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will
have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds we receive from this
offering. Depending on future events and other changes in the business climate,
we may determine at a later time to use the net proceeds for different purposes.
Pending their use, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing debt instruments or bank deposits. These investments may have a
material adverse effect on the U.S. federal income tax consequences of your
investment in our ADSs. These consequences are described in more detail in
“Taxation—United States Federal Income Taxation—Passive Foreign Investment
Company.”"

underwriting discounts and estimated offering expenses, will be approximately
$600.3 million.

    In 2003, two intercompany notes were issued to Clear Channel Communications
in the aggregate original principal amount of approximately $1.5 billion. The
first intercompany note in the original principal amount of approximately
$1.4 billion, the entire principal balance of which remains outstanding, matures
on December 31, 2017, may be prepaid in whole at any time, or in part from time
to time, and accrues interest at a per annum rate of 10%. The second
intercompany note in the original principal amount of $73.0 million, the entire
principal balance of which remains outstanding, matures on December 31, 2017,

interest at a per annum rate of 9%. 

    We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to repay
approximately $600.3 million of the outstanding balances of the $1.4 billion and
$73.0 million intercompany notes. Prior to such use of proceeds, the outstanding
balances of the $1.4 billion and $73.0 million intercompany notes will be
reduced by approximately $362.2 million, the balance at September 30, 2005 in
the “Due from Clear Channel Communications” intercompany account, and
approximately $500.5 million of the remaining outstanding balances of the $1.4
billion and $73.0 million intercompany notes will be contributed to our capital
by Clear Channel Communications, such that the notes are repaid in full.

    Our total indebtedness after this offering and after application of all of
the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of the intercompany
indebtedness owed to Clear Channel Communications will be approximately
$2.7 billion, approximately $2.5 billion of which will be intercompany
indebtedness owed to Clear Channel Communications."

     consummation of an initial transaction, such deferred discount shall be

    $107,426,000, or $124,076,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Morgan
Stanley maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New
York, acting as trustee. Additionally, $2,400,000, or $2,760,000 if the
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, of the proceeds
attributable to the underwriters' discount will be deposited into the trust
account. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
completion of an initial transaction. The proceeds held in the trust account may
be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target with which we complete
an initial transaction (excluding the amount held in the trust account
representing a portion of the underwriters' discount). Any amounts not paid as
consideration to the sellers of the target may be used to finance operations of
the target, to pay costs associated with litigation, to reimburse our management
for amounts advanced to us, including in connection with defending, settling
and/or paying judgments with respect to litigation, or to manage and service the
portfolio or real estate asset and/or acquire additional businesses, financial
assets or real estate assets, other than any fees of the underwriters, held in
the trust account, amounts paid for finders', financial advisor or professional
fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection with any debt
or equity financing made in connection with an initial transaction. We do not
currently have any agreement with any party with respect to the payment of
finders or professional fees. If we agree to pay such fees in the future, such
fees shall be negotiated on an arms-length basis.

    The payment to Full Circle LLC, an affiliate of Richard A. Stratton, of a
monthly fee of $7,500 is for certain administrative, technology and secretarial
services, as well as the use of certain limited office space. This arrangement
was agreed to by Full Circle LLC for our benefit and is not intended to provide
Mr. Stratton compensation in lieu of a salary. We believe, based on rents and
fees for similar services in Fairfield County, Connecticut, that the fee charged
by Full Circle LLC is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an
unaffiliated person. Upon completion of an initial transaction, or our
liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay this monthly fee.

    We intend to use the amount not held in trust ($2,950,000) for director and
officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $250,000), with the balance
of $2,700,000 being held in reserve to pay the administrative fee to Full
Circle LLC ($135,000 ($7,500 per month for 18 months)), due diligence, legal,
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating an initial
transaction, and to pay costs associated with litigation, as well as for
reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by our management in
connection with activities on our behalf as described below. We expect that due
diligence of prospective target companies will be undertaken and coordinated by
our management. Management may, depending on the nature of the proposed
transaction and the target assets, hire industry specialists, risk management
analysts or others to assist with the due diligence process, and we have
estimated that approximately $300,000 may be spent in connection with such due
diligence. We believe that the amount not held in trust will be sufficient to
cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs, although we cannot assure
you this will be the case especially if we negotiate but are not able to
consummate one or more transactions. In addition, although we have no present
intention to do so, it is possible that we will in the future find it necessary
or desirable to use a portion of these funds to make a down payment or deposit
or fund a down payment, lock-up or ""no-shop"" provision, with respect to a
particular transaction. If so, any such amount would be based on the terms of
the specific transaction and the amount of our available funds at the time. If
we use a portion of our funds for such a purpose and the related transaction
does not occur and we are required to forfeit such funds (whether as a result of
our breach of the agreement relating to the original payment or otherwise), we
could, if such payment was large enough and we had already used some or all of
the funds allocated to due diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted
transaction, be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, or to
conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses. In
that event, we may be required to liquidate before the completion of an initial
transaction.

    To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect an initial transaction, the proceeds held in the trust
account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance
our operations or to manage and service the portfolio or real estate asset
and/or acquire additional operating businesses or portfolios of financial assets
or real estate assets.

    Richard A. Stratton, our Chairman of the Board and Chief Executive Officer,
and Joseph S. Weingarten, our President, have advanced to us a total of
$100,000, on a non-interest bearing basis, which was used to pay a portion of
the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. The
advances will be payable on the earlier of June 10, 2006, and the consummation
of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the proceeds of this
offering not be placed in trust.

    Messrs. Stratton and Weingarten have agreed with Deutsche Bank Securities
Inc., the lead underwriter, in accordance with guidelines specified by
Rule 10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, to purchase up to
$2,100,000 of our warrants, on behalf of themselves, their affiliates or their
designees, collectively, in the open market, at a price per warrant not to
exceed $0.70 within the 90-trading days beginning on the date that the warrants
begin to trade separately (and not less than 60 days after the end of the
""restricted period"" under Regulation M (as further described in this
prospectus)). These warrants may not be sold or transferred until after the
completion of an initial transaction. A broker-dealer who has not participated
in this offering has agreed to make the purchases of the warrants on behalf of
Messrs. Stratton and Weingarten in such amounts and at such times as that
broker-dealer may determine, in its sole discretion, subject to any regulatory
restrictions.

    The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will only be invested in
United States ""government securities,"" defined as any Treasury Bill issued by
the United States having a maturity of one hundred and eighty days or less, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act of 1940. The interest income derived from investment of these net proceeds
during this period will be used to defray our general and administrative
expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance with securities laws and
regulations, including associated professional fees, until an initial
transaction is completed.

    We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 18 months, assuming that an
initial transaction is not consummated during that time.

    Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the consummation
of an initial transaction, we will pay Full Circle LLC the administrative
services fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month fee, no
compensation of any kind (including finder's and consulting fees) will be paid
to any of our initial stockholders, our officers or directors, or any of their
affiliates or family members, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of the initial transaction. However, these
persons will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by
them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential
targets and performing due diligence on suitable initial transactions. Since the
role of present management after an initial transaction is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after an initial transaction.

    A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust
account (including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust
account) only in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder were
to seek to convert our shares into cash in connection with an initial
transaction which the public stockholder voted against and which we consummate.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

    Upon the consummation of an initial transaction, the underwriters will be
entitled to receive that portion of the proceeds attributable to the
underwriters' discount held in trust. In the event that we are unable to
consummate an initial transaction and the trustee is forced to liquidate the
trust account, the underwriters have agreed that: (i) they will forfeit any
rights or claims to such proceeds and any accrued interest thereon; and (ii) the
proceeds attributable to the underwriters' discount will be distributed on a
pro-rata basis among the public shareholders along with any accrued interest
thereon."

the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

    We currently expect to use the net proceeds of this offering for research
and development activities to enhance our existing NROM technology, expand our
business development and marketing activities, and the remaining proceeds for
general corporate purposes and working capital.

    We will have broad discretion in the way that we use the net proceeds of
this offering. The amounts that we actually spend for the purposes described
above may vary significantly and will depend, in part, on the timing and amount
of our future revenues.

    We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary companies, products or technologies, although we currently do not
have any acquisitions or investments planned.

    Pending use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the

common stock in this offering, at an initial public offering price of $7.00 per 
share, will be approximately $38.4 million, or approximately $44.3 million if 
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. This estimate is 
after deduction of all estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and 
estimated offering expenses that are payable by us. Net proceeds from this 
offering are not reduced by $1.6 million of offering expenses that the Company 
charged to expense in the nine months ended September 30, 2005 in accordance 
with Staff Accounting Bulletin Topic 5A. 

We plan to use the net proceeds from this offering principally to fund: 

• development of our current portfolio of seven clinical stage product 
candidates; and 

• development of our preclinical stage product candidates. 

We plan to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering to fund: 

• discovery and development of additional product candidates; 

• further development of our drug discovery technology; and 

• working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering for 
in-licensing of products or technologies or acquisitions of complementary 
businesses, but we have no current agreements or commitments relating to any of 
these types of transactions. 

We estimate that we will use approximately $3.3 million of the net proceeds from 
this offering for external clinical trial expenses to complete the current phase 
IIa or phase I/II studies for CRx-139, CRx-102, CRx-119, CRx-170, CRx-140, 
CRx-150 and CRx-026. We plan to make decisions regarding any additional early 
stage clinical trials or which of our product candidates to advance into later 
stage clinical trials based on the human clinical data obtained from these 
phase IIa or phase I/II studies. We cannot predict at this time which, if any, 
product candidates will be advanced into later stage clinical trials. We 
estimate that if one of our product candidates is advanced, the external 
clinical trial expenses for administering a later stage clinical trial for a 
product candidate will be approximately $9.0 million for one phase IIb trial 
and $33.0 million for one phase III clinical trial. As a result, the actual 
amount of our external clinical trial expenses will depend on the results of 
prior clinical trials and the number of product candidates advanced into later 
stage clinical trials. 

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the progress of our research, the advancement of product 
candidates into clinical trials, timing and results of clinical studies, timing 
of regulatory submissions, any terms or conditions imposed by regulatory 
agencies, opportunities for in-licensing arrangements or acquisitions, the 
amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering and the amount of cash used 
by our operations. 

We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for 
any of the purposes listed above. Our management will have broad discretion to 
allocate the net proceeds from this offering. Pending such use of the net 
proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in accordance 
with our investment policy, which includes investments in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment-grade securities or guaranteed obligations of the United 
States or other governments or their agencies."

deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and structuring fees, but
before paying estimated transaction expenses) from the sale of 15,000,000 common
units offered by this prospectus. We based this amount on the initial public
offering price of $19.50 per common unit.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to:

    •   repay $250.0 million of the indebtedness we will assume from BPHC in       
        connection with the contribution of its interests in Boardwalk Pipelines to
        us. The indebtedness has an interest rate of LIBOR plus 1.5% per annum (the
        interest rate was 5.37% as of September 30, 2005), is owed to Loews        
        Corporation, is payable on demand and was incurred in connection with the  
        acquisition of Gulf South;                                                 

    •   provide approximately $21.4 million in additional working capital for our  
        subsidiaries to replenish amounts distributed by Boardwalk Pipelines prior 
        to contribution of the equity of Boardwalk Pipelines to us by BPHC; and    

    •   pay approximately $2.4 million of transaction expenses associated with the 
        offering and related formation transactions.                               

If the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units,
we will use the net proceeds of such purchase, together with amounts contributed
by our general partner to maintain its 2% interest, to reduce amounts which we
expect will be outstanding under our credit facility. The amounts outstanding
under the credit facility will be incurred at or prior to the offering to
reimburse approximately $42.1 million of capital expenditures incurred by BPHC
in connection with the acquisition of Gulf South. Affiliates of certain of the
underwriters are expected to be lenders under our credit facility and will
receive their respective share of any repayment by us of amounts outstanding
under the credit facility from the proceeds of any exercise of the option to
purchase additional common units."

million, or $75.2 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and other
estimated expenses payable by us of $8.2 million, or $9.0 million, respectively.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering to:

    •   repay all outstanding principal and accrued interest under our credit      
        facility with Cisco Capital, which was $62.9 million as of June 30, 2005,  
        and terminate the facility; and

        including increased capital expenditures and startup costs (primarily      
        selling, general and administrative expenses) for our expansion into two   
        new markets by the end of 2009, in addition to the four new markets we have
        already scheduled for expansion using existing funds and cash we expect to 
        generate from operations (without regard to any net proceeds from this     
        offering) over the same period.                                            

The amounts borrowed under our existing credit facility are due in full on March
31, 2010. At June 30, 2005, the outstanding indebtedness under our credit
facility was $62.9 million, which bears interest at an effective rate of 6.75%.
We used the borrowings under our credit facility during 2004, amounting to
approximately $13.5 million, for purchases of property and equipment. Upon early
repayment of this debt, we will recognize a gain of approximately $5.0 million
relating to the remaining carrying value in excess of principal recorded in
conjunction with our troubled debt restructuring. Concurrently with this
offering, we have received a commitment from DBTCA, an affiliate of Deutsche
Bank Securities Inc., for a $10.0 million secured revolving line of credit.

We are not currently a party to any agreements or commitments and we have no
current understandings with respect to any acquisitions, although we review
potential acquisition candidates and business combination proposals from time to
time.

We have not determined the amounts we plan to spend on certain of the items
listed above or the timing of these expenditures. As a result, we will have
broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering. Until we use
the net proceeds, we may invest them in short-term, interest-bearing, investment
grade and U.S. government securities."

ADSs in this offering. Net proceeds are what we will receive after payment of
our share of all underwriting discounts, commissions and our expenses relating
to this offering, net of expense reimbursements. We will not receive any of the
proceeds from any sale of ADSs by the selling shareholders to cover
over-allotments.

We expect to use our net proceeds from this offering approximately as follows:

    •   US$8.5 million for repayments of certain outstanding debt;

    •   US$5.0 million to expand our sales, distribution and technical support     
        network;                                                                   

    •   US$4.0 million for capital expenditures, such as the purchase of real      
        estate and the construction of new facilities to be used as our new        
        headquarters;                                                              

  •   US$2.0 million to expand our research and development efforts; and

  •   the balance to fund working capital and general corporate purposes.

The outstanding debt we intend to repay consists of US$8.5 million of short-term
borrowings from various local financial institutions. These short-term
borrowings have a maturity date of less than one year, bear interest at a
weighted average rate of 5.89% and have all been guaranteed by Mr. Seo Kyu Lee,
our chief executive officer. Mr. Lee has also guaranteed certain of our other
short-term and long-term borrowings which we do not expect to repay from our net
proceeds from this offering. 

The amount and timing of our actual expenditures of the net proceeds will depend
on several factors, including:

  •   our need for specific capital expenditures;

  •   the progress of our research and development efforts; and

  •   the amount of cash generated or used by our ongoing operations.

Except as discussed above, we have not made any other specific expenditure plans
with respect to our net proceeds. Accordingly, our management will have
significant flexibility in applying our net proceeds. Pending their use, we
intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term,
interest-bearing debt instruments."

offering will be approximately $69,030,000 after deducting the underwriters’
discounts and commissions and our payment of the expenses of this offering
estimated to be $3,900,000. We intend to use approximately $47,000,000 of our
net proceeds from this offering to increase the capital and surplus of Twin
Bridges to at least $50,000,000, $5,000,000 to pay the entire amount outstanding
under our revolving credit facility with KeyBank National Association, or
KeyBank, and the balance for general corporate purposes. From time to time we
may contribute further amounts to Twin Bridges as additional surplus. As of
September 30, 2005, a total of $3,500,000 was outstanding under our revolving
credit facility. In October 2005, we borrowed an additional $1,000,000 under
this facility and in December 2005, we borrowed an additional $500,000 under
this facility, each to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering. The loans
outstanding under the revolving credit facility are due and payable on June 30,
2006 and bear interest at the prime rate of KeyBank from time to time. The
proceeds of the loans outstanding as of September 30, 2005 were used to pay
distributions to members of our subsidiaries. Any decision to allocate to our
U.S. subsidiaries a portion of our net proceeds from this offering may be
constrained because we will be required to pay a 30% withholding tax on any
distribution from our U.S. subsidiaries to us.

deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses payable by
us. We intend to use approximately $76.3 million of the net proceeds of this
offering to prepay our outstanding subordinated notes and accrued interest,
which includes a $740,000 prepayment premium. Our $37.0 million of senior
subordinated notes bear interest at LIBOR plus 8.0% (11.95% at September 30,
2005) and mature June 2011. Our $37.0 million of junior subordinated notes bear
interest at 12.0% per annum and mature June 2012. We issued the subordinated
notes in connection with our June 2004 recapitalization and special dividend
payment.

    We also intend to use approximately $5.9 million of the net proceeds of this
offering to terminate our sale bonus agreements with various key employees. We
intend to use the remaining net proceeds, together with available cash or
revolving credit borrowings, to terminate our management agreement with Trivest
Partners, L.P., and our associate equity gain program. 

    We will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of
common stock by the selling shareholders, which are approximately $51.2 million,
or $72.1 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is
exercised in full."

(1) $185,013 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the   
    NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange   
    filing fee and a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance and legal  
    and audit fees, have been paid from the $225,000 we received from Jonathan J.
    Ledecky and Eric J. Watson described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of 
    this offering.                                                               

(2) For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts and non-accountable 
    expense allowance are reflected as the amounts that are payable to the       
    underwriters upon consummation of this offering. An additional $2,190,000, or
    $2,406,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which   
    will be deposited in trust following the consummation of this offering, is   
    payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a business        
    combination.                                                                 

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $1,385,000  
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                     

$112,190,000, or $129,326,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney, a division of
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the
underwriting discounts and commissions, including the non-accountable expense
allowance, payable to the underwriters in the offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amounts will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination.

The payment to Ironbound Partners, an entity of which Jonathan J. Ledecky, our
president, is chairman, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Ironbound Partners for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Ledecky compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York
City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Ironbound Partners is at least
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$7,500 per month administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination. However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in
the above table to “Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due
diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.”
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a business combination
will be approximately $1,385,000. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $525,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $100,000), with the balance of $425,000 being held in reserve for
tax payments and in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds
not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping
around” for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such
target business) with respect to a particular proposed business combination,
although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into such
a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a
target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
“no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be held as cash or
cash equivalents or will be invested only in United States “government
securities” or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7
promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed
to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. The income derived
from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used to defray
our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to compliance
with securities laws and regulations, including associated professional fees,
until a business combination is completed.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate a business combination will be
disbursed to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds
not expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Because we do not have any specific business combination under
consideration and have not (nor has anyone on our behalf) contacted any
prospective target business or had any discussions, formal or otherwise, with
respect to such a transaction, it is impossible at this time to determine how we
would, following a business combination, use any proceeds held in the trust
account which are not used to consummate such business combination.

Jonathan J. Ledecky and Eric J. Watson have each advanced to us $112,500 (for a
total of $225,000) which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this
offering referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, NASD
filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange listing
fee, and a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance, legal and audit
fees and expenses. The loans will be payable without interest on the earlier of
September 1, 2006 or the consummation of this offering. The loans will be repaid
out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account) only
in the event of our liquidation or if that public stockholder (but not our
existing stockholders) converts such shares into cash in connection with a
business combination which the public stockholder voted against and which we
consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right
or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

(1) $185,013 of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the   
    NASD filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange   
    filing fee and a portion of the non-accountable expense allowance and legal  
    and audit fees, have been paid from the $225,000 we received from Jonathan J.
    Ledecky and Eric J. Watson described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of 
    this offering.                                                               

(2) For purposes of presentation, the underwriting discounts and non-accountable 
    expense allowance are reflected as the amounts that are payable to the       
    underwriters upon consummation of this offering. An additional $2,190,000, or
    $2,406,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full, all of which   
    will be deposited in trust following the consummation of this offering, is   
    payable to the underwriters only if and when we consummate a business        
    combination.                                                                 

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at $1,385,000  
    even if the over-allotment is exercised.                                     

$112,190,000, or $129,326,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Smith Barney, a division of
Citigroup Global Markets, Inc., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, New York, New York, as trustee. This amount includes a portion of the
underwriting discounts and commissions, including the non-accountable expense
allowance, payable to the underwriters in the offering. The underwriters have
agreed that such amounts will not be paid unless and until we consummate a
business combination and have waived their right to receive such payment upon
our liquidation if we are unable to complete a business combination. The funds
held in trust will be invested only in United States “government securities”
within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940,
so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment
Company Act. The proceeds will not be released from the trust account until the
earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination.

The payment to Ironbound Partners, an entity of which Jonathan J. Ledecky, our
president, is chairman, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by Ironbound Partners for our
benefit and is not intended to provide Mr. Ledecky compensation in lieu of a
salary. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services in the New York
City metropolitan area, that the fee charged by Ironbound Partners is at least
as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. This
arrangement will terminate upon completion of a business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$7,500 per month administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including
finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing
officers, directors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for
any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the
business combination. However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for
any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our
behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due
diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations as well as
traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective
target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses
will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated in
the above table to “Legal, accounting and other expenses attendant to the due
diligence investigations, structuring and negotiation of a business
combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses” and “Working
capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes and reserves.”
Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain,
we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those
persons after a business combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds available to us out of trust for our search for a business combination
will be approximately $1,385,000. We intend to use the excess working capital
(approximately $525,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums
(approximately $100,000), with the balance of $425,000 being held in reserve for
tax payments and in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on our behalf as
described below. We believe that the excess working capital will be sufficient
to cover the foregoing expenses and reimbursement costs. We could use a portion
of the funds not being placed in trust to pay fees to consultants to assist us
with our search for a target business. We could also use a portion of the funds
not being placed in trust as a down payment or to fund a “no-shop” provision (a
provision in letters of intent designed to keep target businesses from “shopping
around” for transactions with other companies on terms more favorable to such
target business) with respect to a particular proposed business combination,
although we do not have any current intention to do so. If we entered into such
a letter of intent where we paid for the right to receive exclusivity from a
target business, the amount that would be used as a down payment or to fund a
“no-shop” provision would be determined based on the terms of the specific
business combination and the amount of our available funds at the time. Our
forfeiture of such funds (whether as a result of our breach or
otherwise) could result in our not having sufficient funds to continue searching
for, or conducting due diligence with respect to, potential target businesses.

    On February 10, 2005, we entered into a $450.0 million senior secured credit
agreement, comprised of a $100.0 million revolving credit facility and a
$350.0 million term loan. We borrowed the full amount of the term loan and
$20.2 million under the revolving credit facility to fund our acquisition of AMR
and EmCare, including the payment of related fees and expenses, and we have used
balances outstanding from time to time under the revolving credit facility for
working capital purposes. As of September 30, 2005, we had $5.0 million of
borrowings outstanding under the revolving credit facility and we had
approximately $67.7 million of availability under that facility, net of
outstanding letters of credit of $27.3 million. Commitments under our revolving
credit facility terminate on February 10, 2010. We intend to repay
$100.0 million of the term loan with the proceeds of this offering. The term
loan and the revolving credit facility bear interest at variable rates (5.98% at

———————

(1)A portion of these expenses have been paid from the funds we received from Mr.
Tsirigakis described below. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of
this offering not being placed in trust upon consummation of this offering.

(2)Represents 4% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 18,867,500 units in
this offering ($7,547,000) and 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
2,830,125 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment option ($566,025).

(3)Represents 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 18,867,500 units in
this offering ($3,773,500) and 4% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the
2,830,125 units subject to the underwriters’ over-allotment
option ($1,132,050) that will be paid to the underwriters only upon consummation
of a business combination and then only with respect to those units as to which
the component shares have not been redeemed. If a business combination is not
consummated and we are liquidated, such amounts will be distributed among our
public stockholders.

(4)Represents 2% of the gross proceeds from the sale of the 1,132,500 units in the
private placement ($226,500) that will be paid to Maxim Group LLC on the same
terms and subject to the same conditions as the payment of the contingent
underwriting compensation.

$188,675,000 or $216,410,225 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full, of proceeds will be placed in a trust account at Lehman
Brothers Inc. maintained by American Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York,
New York, as trustee. Of this amount, up to $4,000,000 ($5,132,050 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of contingent
underwriting compensation and placement fees will be paid to the underwriters if
and only if a business combination is consummated. Other than up to $2,500,000
of interest income, net of taxes thereon, which may be released to us to fund
our working capital requirements, the proceeds held in trust will not be
released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account
(exclusive of any funds held for the benefit of the underwriters or used to pay
stockholders who have exercised their redemption right) may be used as
consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately
complete a business combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the
sellers of the target business (other than amounts paid for finders’ or
professional fees or amounts paid for any fees or costs incurred in connection
with any debt or equity financing made in connection with the business
combination) may be used to finance operations of the target business.

We have agreed to pay the law firm of Schwartz & Weiss, P.C., which is not
affiliated with us, $7,500 per month for office space and general and
administrative services including secretarial support.

We have estimated that costs related to the acquisition of a target business
will be approximately $900,000; approximately $500,000 to identify and research
prospective target businesses and approximately $400,000 for costs related to
the business combination, including legal and accounting expenses to structure
the transaction, prepare the transaction documents and file the related proxy
statement. Only $150,000 of the net proceeds have been allocated for such
purposes and we intend to fund the balance, as well as amounts that may exceed
our current estimates, from a portion of the interest earned on the proceeds
being held in the trust account. We have agreed with the representative that
one-half of the interest earned on the proceeds being held in the trust account
for our benefit (net of taxes payable), after a certain threshold amount, will
be released to us, up to a maximum of $2,500,000. The threshold amount is based
on the following formula: for each unit purchased by the underwriters upon their
exercise of their over-allotment option, $0.20 of interest must be maintained in
the trust account. Accordingly, if the underwriters do not exercise the
over-allotment option, the threshold amount is $0 and if such option is
exercised in full, the threshold amount will be $566,025. Although we do not
know the rate of interest to be earned on the trust account, we believe that
even at an interest rate of 1.5% per annum, the interest available to us on the
$184,675,000 of trust proceeds will be sufficient to fund our working capital
requirements. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will
be performed by some or all of our officers and directors, but is expected to
include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Our
officers and directors will not receive any compensation for their due diligence
of prospective target businesses, but will be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket
expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with such due
diligence activities.

We intend to use the net proceeds allocated to working capital (approximately
$200,000) for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately
$150,000), with the balance being held for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket
expenses incurred by our existing stockholders in connection with activities on
our behalf as described below. We have agreed with Maxim Group LLC that half of
the interest earned on the trust account (net of taxes payable) in excess of the
amount necessary to have a $10.00 per share liquidation distribution to the
public stockholders if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised
(i.e. $566,025 if the option is exercised in full) up to a maximum of $2,500,000
will be released to us to fund our working capital. We believe that the amount
allocated to working capital, together with interest earned on the trust account
available to us will be sufficient to cover the costs related to the acquisition
of a target business and reimbursement costs, even if the costs of due
diligence, legal, accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating a
business combination exceed our estimates.

It is also possible that we could use a portion of our working capital to make a
deposit, down payment or fund a “no-shop” provision with respect to a particular
proposed business combination, although we do not have any current intention to
do so. In the event that we were ultimately required to forfeit such funds
(whether as a result of our breach of the agreement relating to such payment or 
otherwise), if such payment was large enough and we had already used up the funds 
available for due diligence and related expenses in connection with the aborted 
transaction, we could be left with insufficient funds to continue searching for, 
or conduct due diligence with respect to, other potential target businesses. Thus, if 
we were unable to secure additional financing, we would most likely fail to consummate a
business combination in the allotted time and would be forced to liquidate. It
is possible that our existing stockholders could advance us the additional
required funds, thereby increasing the amount of excess out-of-pocket expenses
that might be reimbursed following a business combination.

To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the
operations of the target business.

As of the date of this prospectus, Akis Tsirigakis, our chief executive officer,
has advanced to us a total of $390,000, which was used to pay a portion of the
expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for SEC
registration fee, NASD registration fee, legal fees and expenses and an advances
on Maxim’s non-accountable expense allowance. Such loans will be payable with 4%
annual interest on the earlier of May 31, 2006 or the consummation of this
offering. The loans will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not
being placed in trust.

The net proceeds of this offering which are not held in the trust account and
not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only
in United States “government securities,” defined as any Treasury Bills issued
by the United States having a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market
funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the
Investment Company Act of 1940 so that we are not deemed to be an investment
company under the Investment Company Act.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming that a
business combination is not consummated during that time.

No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees) will be
paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of their affiliates, from us or
from any other party for any services rendered to us prior to or in connection
with the consummation of the business combination. Our existing stockholders
will only be entitled to receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf. To the extent that
such out-of-pocket expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless
we consummate a business combination, in which event this reimbursement
obligation would in all likelihood be negotiated with the owners of a target
business. Since the role of present management after a business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after a business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account, net
of taxes payable and interest amounts previously released to us) only in the
event of liquidation upon our failure to complete a business combination within
the allotted time or if that public stockholder were to seek to redeem such
shares for cash in connection with a business combination which the public
stockholder voted against and which we actually consummate. In no other
circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account."

hereby will be approximately $471 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, the net proceeds from
this offering will be approximately $529 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. The
primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our Class A
common stock, obtain additional equity capital and facilitate future access to
public markets.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for working capital,
capital expenditures and general corporate purposes. The amounts actually
expended for each purpose and the timing of such expenditures will depend on a
number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations.
Pending their use, we may invest the net proceeds of this offering in
short-term, investment grade securities.

A portion of the indebtedness of our subsidiary, Spansion Japan, will become due
and payable as a result of this offering if we cannot amend the terms of, or
arrange for a new facility to refinance, such indebtedness by December 31, 2005.
This indebtedness consists of borrowings under the Spansion Japan Term Loan and
a sale-leaseback transaction entered into in January 2005, the terms of which
are described under “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Contractual Obligations.” As of September 25, 2005,
these borrowings amounted to approximately $139 million, of which approximately
$85 million was outstanding under the Spansion Japan Term Loan and approximately
$53.7 million was outstanding under the Spansion Japan sale-leaseback
transaction. If we cannot amend the terms of, or arrange for a new facility to
refinance, this indebtedness prior to December 31, 2005, we will use a portion
of the net proceeds from this offering to repay this indebtedness.

Concurrently with this offering, Spansion LLC, our indirect wholly-owned
subsidiary, intends to issue $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior
unsecured notes in a private placement. To the extent that Spansion LLC is
unable to place the full $400 million aggregate principal amount of senior
unsecured notes on acceptable terms, one or both of AMD and Fujitsu will
purchase senior subordinated unsecured notes such that the total aggregate
principal amount of senior unsecured notes and senior subordinated unsecured
notes will total $400 million. Any notes purchased by one or both of AMD and
Fujitsu will be subordinated to the senior unsecured notes and consequently may
bear interest at a rate that is up to 150 basis points higher than the interest
rate on the senior unsecured notes, but the terms of which will otherwise be
substantially similar to the senior unsecured notes.

We intend to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of the notes to
repay in full the outstanding principal and interest on the AMD Cash Note and
the AMD Asset Note, the terms of which are described under “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Contractual Obligations,” which we issued to AMD in connection with our
reorganization as Spansion LLC in June 2003. These notes bear interest at the
London Interbank Offered Rate, or LIBOR, plus four percent, to be paid
quarterly. The interest rate adjusts each calendar quarter based on LIBOR and
cannot exceed seven percent. We are required to repay the principal amount of
these notes as follows: 75 percent on March 31, 2006 and any remaining amounts
on June 30, 2006, provided that upon completion of this offering and the
concurrent notes offering, we will repay the AMD Cash Note and AMD Asset Note in
full including accrued and unpaid interest. As of September 25, 2005, the
remaining principal balance on the AMD Cash Note was $120 million and the
remaining principal balance on the AMD Asset Note was approximately $162
million. Upon the consummation of this offering, AMD will cancel $60 million of
the aggregate principal amount outstanding under the AMD Cash Note in exchange
for 5,000,000 shares of our Class A common stock. We will use the net proceeds
from the concurrent notes offering to repay any remaining amounts outstanding
(including accrued and unpaid interest) under the AMD Cash Note and AMD Asset
Note.

In connection with our reorganization in June 2003, we issued an unsecured
promissory note in an amount of approximately 146 million Malaysian Ringgit
(approximately $38 million based on the exchange rate as of
September 25, 2005), payable to AMD’s subsidiary in Malaysia, AMD Export Sdn.
Bhd., or AMD Export, in connection with the sale of assets by AMD Export to our
wholly-owned subsidiary in Malaysia, Spansion Penang Sdn. Bhd., or Spansion
Penang. This note bears interest at a fixed rate of seven percent, to be paid
quarterly. Spansion Penang is required to repay approximately 110 million
Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $29 million based on the exchange rate as of
September 25, 2005) of the principal amount of the note on March 31, 2006 and
the remaining principal amount of the note on June 29, 2006, provided that upon
completion of this offering and our concurrent notes offering, Spansion Penang
is required to repay the note in full including accrued and unpaid interest on
the note. As of September 25, 2005, the remaining balance on this note was
approximately 146 million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $38 million based on
the exchange rate as of September 25, 2005). As part of our reorganization as
Spansion LLC in June 2003, we also assumed $60 million of unsecured debt,
payable by our subsidiary in the People’s Republic of China, Spansion China
Limited, or Spansion China, to AMD. Amounts outstanding bear interest at rates
ranging from two percent to six percent, to be paid quarterly. Spansion China is
required to pay the remaining balance on the debt on March 26, 2006 or such
later date as the parties may agree upon in writing, and all borrowings made by
Spansion China after the effective date of the amendment shall bear interest at
a rate of 3.46 percent, compounded annually. As of September 25, 2005, the
remaining balance on this unsecured debt was approximately $15 million. On
January 29, 2004, Spansion Penang entered into a financial arrangement with AMD
Export. Under the terms of the arrangement, Spansion Penang borrowed
approximately 29 million Malaysian Ringgit (approximately $8 million based on
the exchange rate as of September 25, 2005) from AMD Export to fund the purchase
of manufacturing equipment. A third-party financial institution has a lien on
the purchased equipment. The loan bears interest at a fixed rate of 5.9 percent
and is payable in equal, consecutive, monthly principal and interest
installments through February 2009. The total amount outstanding under this
arrangement as of September 25, 2005 was approximately 20 million Malaysian
Ringgit (approximately $6 million based on the exchange rate as of September 25,
2005). We also intend to apply a portion of the net proceeds from the sale of
the notes, and to the the extent required, a portion of the net proceeds from
this offering, to repay in full the outstanding principal and interest on such
indebtedness.

On September 19, 2005, we entered into a new senior secured revolving credit
facility, the terms of which are described under “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Contractual
Obligations,” and we borrowed approximately $60 million under this facility, a
portion of which was used to pay off in full approximately $24 million of our
outstanding borrowings under our July 2003 Spansion Term Loan with the remainder
being used for working capital. As of December 14, 2005, $60 million was
outstanding under this facility and bears interest at a rate of 7.25 percent. We
intend to apply a portion of the net proceeds from Spansion LLC’s sale of the
notes, and to the extent required, a portion of the net proceeds from this
offering, to repay in full the outstanding principal and interest on such
indebtedness."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, based on
the initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds will be approximately $57.0 million.

    The principal purposes for this offering are to fund our development
activities, including clinical trials for our three internal development
programs, to increase our working capital, to create a public market for our
common stock, to increase our ability to access the capital markets in the
future, for general corporate purposes and to provide liquidity for our existing
stockholders. We may spend a portion of the net proceeds on sales and marketing
activities, general and administrative matters and on capital expenditures.

    We intend to use approximately $28 to $31 million of the net proceeds from
this offering to fund research and development activities, including
approximately $19 to $21 million to fund the continued clinical development of
SILENORtm and approximately $7 to $12 million to fund the further development of
our other clinical development programs. However, due to the risks inherent in
the clinical trial process and given the stage of development of our programs,
we are unable to estimate with any certainty the total costs or when we will
incur these costs in the continued development of our product candidates for
potential commercialization. We anticipate that the net proceeds from this
offering will allow us to complete the clinical trials necessary to support an
NDA filing for SILENORtm. In addition, we cannot forecast with any degree of
certainty which drug candidates will be subject to future collaborative or
licensing arrangements, when such arrangements will be secured, if at all, and
to what degree such arrangements would affect our development plans and capital
requirements.

    Of the remaining $18 to $21 million of the net proceeds from this offering,
we anticipate using approximately half to fund other regulatory and development
activities and the other half to fund marketing, general and administrative
expenses.

    We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products or to obtain rights to such complementary
technologies. We have no commitments with respect to any such acquisitions or
investments.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors, including the progress in, and costs of, our clinical drug programs and
the amount and timing of revenues, if any, from our current or future
collaborations. We therefore cannot estimate the amount of net proceeds to be
used for all of the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing,
investment-grade securities."

estimated underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses paid by us,
will be approximately $216.7 million ($250.2 million if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full). The principal
purposes of this offering are to reduce our indebtedness and to increase our
financial flexibility.

Repayment of Debt Related to Initial Properties:

We expect to use approximately $157.1 million of these net proceeds to repay the
remaining principal balance, together with accumulated interest and fees at the
time of the closing of the offering, of outstanding indebtedness, as follows:

†    approximately $60.9 million to partially repay a loan entered into in
December 2004 in connection with our acquisition of the Presidents Park I, II
and III properties. As of December 14, 2005, the outstanding balance was
approximately $93.8 million. The loan bears interest at London Inter Bank
Offering Rate, or LIBOR, plus 4%, which was 8.1% on October 31, 2005. The loan
matures in January 2006. We may borrow approximately $32.9 million from an
affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc. (including $2.0 million to repay borrowings
subsequent to September 30, 2005) to refinance the remaining portion of
Presidents Park debt if we do not obtain an extension of the maturity date or
otherwise refinance this loan prior to its maturity date. See “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources;”

†    approximately $17.0 million to fully repay a junior loan entered into in
December 2004 in connection with our acquisition of the Presidents Park I, II
and III properties. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 10%, which was 14.1%
on October 31, 2005. The loan matures in January 2006;

†    approximately $46.0 million to fully repay a loan entered into in
January 2004 in connection with our acquisition of the Campus at Dulles
Technology Center property. The loan bears interest at LIBOR plus 2.8%, which
was 6.9% on October 31, 2005. The loan matures in February 2007;

†    approximately $31.2 million to fully repay a loan entered into in June 2005
in connection with our acquisition of the Republic Building property. The loan
currently bears interest at LIBOR plus 5.5%, which was 9.6% on October 31, 2005.
The loan matures in June 2006; and

†  approximately $2.0 million to pay fees in connection with the exit from and
the assumption of certain indebtedness on our properties.

The approximate $157.1 million of net proceeds from this offering and the
approximate $32.9 million of anticipated new indebtedness will be used to repay
approximately $190.0 million of existing debt and related fees, which includes
repayment of a net increase in debt of approximately $2.0 million from activity
after September 30, 2005. The September 30, 2005 pro forma balance sheet shows
approximately $188.0 million in cash and new borrowings used to pay off existing
debt and related fees."

1,000,000 shares of our common stock, using the public offering price of $16.00
per share and after deducting the underwriting discount and other estimated
offering expenses. We will receive additional net proceeds of up to $2.2 million
if the underwriter exercises the option granted to it in connection with this
offering to cover over-allotments.

We will use some of the net proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness of
approximately $2.5 million and to increase the capital of our bank by
approximately $8.0 million, which will enable it to maintain its status as a
“well capitalized” institution as its assets increase, as well as to fund the
costs of new branches. Our business plan calls for the addition of four new
branches in the next few years and we estimate that each branch will cost
approximately $1.5 to $2.0 million. We may also use some of the proceeds for our
administrative expenses. Except for payment of such expenses, the remaining net
proceeds will be temporarily invested and will be available to further increase
the capital of the bank or for other activities in which a bank holding company
is permitted to engage.

The following table demonstrates the distribution of our planned use of the net
proceeds described above:

    On April 15, 2005, we and one of our subsidiaries, DealerTrack, Inc.,
entered into credit facilities comprised of a $25.0 million revolving credit
facility and a $25.0 million term loan facility. We used the proceeds of the
credit facilities to fund a portion of the Chrome, NAT and ALG acquisitions in
May 2005. We are required to use up to 25% of the net offering proceeds to repay
the term loan facility. As of September 30, 2005, we had $25.0 million of
indebtedness outstanding under our term loan facility and $18.5 million
outstanding under our revolving credit facility. We will use $43.5 million of
the estimated net proceeds to repay all of the currently outstanding
indebtedness under our credit facilities. The remaining $60.0 million of the
estimated net proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. We will have
broad discretion as to the use of these remaining proceeds and may apply them to
product development efforts, to acquisitions or to establish strategic
alliances. We have no definitive agreements with respect to future acquisitions
or strategic alliances and have no commitments with respect to these remaining
net proceeds. The revolving credit facility matures on April 15, 2008, and as of
September 30, 2005, bore an interest rate of 5.03%. The term loan facility
matures on April 15, 2010, and as of September 30, 2005, bore an interest rate
of 5.02%. For additional information on our credit facilities.

    Pending use of the remaining net proceeds as described above, we intend to
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, marketable securities.

    The affiliates of the underwriters that are lenders under our credit
facilities will receive a portion of the proceeds to us from this offering,
which will be used to repay the credit facilities in an amount proportional to
each lender’s respective outstanding loan amounts under the credit facilities.
An affiliate of Lehman Brothers will receive 40%, an affiliate of J.P. Morgan
will receive 40% and an affiliate of Wachovia will receive 20%, respectively, of
the $43.5 million of the net offering proceeds."

offering will be approximately $9.8 million after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our
net proceeds will be approximately $11.4 million.

We intend to use approximately $3.0 million of the net proceeds of this offering
to reduce CapitalSouth debt. The debt to be paid off consists of two notes, both
payable to Alabama Banker’s Bank. One note, dated May 19, 2005, is in the
original principal amount of $1.2 million and carries a variable interest rate
of 175 basis points over 3-month LIBOR. This note evidences the refinancing of a
note entered into by CapitalSouth in 2003, the proceeds from which were used to
purchase common stock of CapitalSouth now held as treasury stock. The other
note, dated September 8, 2005, is in the original principal amount of $1.8
million and also carries a variable interest rate of 175 basis points over
3-month LIBOR. This note provided interim financing for the asset growth of
CapitalSouth Bank, which historically has had relatively higher capital needs
than CapitalSouth or Capital Bank. Both notes have a term of 12 months and are
secured by the common stock of CapitalSouth Bank. Neither note assesses a
penalty against us for prepayment.

We intend to contribute approximately $7.0 million of the net proceeds of this
offering to our subsidiary banks to provide them with capital to support the
expected asset growth resulting from our expansion into Florida, the second
“Banco Hispano” branded banking office of CapitalSouth Bank in Birmingham,
Alabama, and the second Capital Bank banking office in Montgomery, Alabama. We
anticipate approximately $2.3 million in costs associated with the opening of
these new locations. Historically, our investment to open a full service banking
office has run between $150,000 and $1.6 million, depending primarily on whether
it is a leased or an owned facility. Leased facilities generally require an
investment of $150,000 to $400,000, whereas an owned facility requires an
investment of approximately $1,000,000 plus the cost of the land. We will use
the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, which may include,
among other things, our working capital needs and investments in our subsidiary
banks to support our growth, including development of additional banking
offices. Additionally, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to finance bank
acquisitions, though we have no present plans in that regard.

Until we use the proceeds, we will invest them temporarily in a money market
account at one of our subsidiary banks. The precise amounts and timing of our
use of the net proceeds will depend upon market conditions and the availability
of other funds, among other factors. From time to time, we may engage in
additional capital financings as we determine to be appropriate based upon our
needs and prevailing market conditions. These additional capital financings may
include the sale of securities other than, or in addition to, common stock."

offering to expand our sales and marketing operations and approximately $3-5
million in research and development activities. We intend to use the remainder
of the proceeds for working capital and general corporate purposes. We may also
use a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or
acquisitions of, complementary businesses, products or technologies. We have no
current agreements or commitments with respect to any investment or acquisition,
and we are not engaged in negotiations with respect to any investment or
acquisition. Pending an ultimate use, we intend to invest the net proceeds to us
from this offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade securities.

preservation and liquidity so that such funds are readily available to fund our
operations.

significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future sales
and cash generated by operations and the other factors as described in “Risk
Factors.”  Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use the net
proceeds from this offering."

$91.8 million, based on an initial public offering price of $20.00 per share and
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses. We will not receive any of the net proceeds from the sale of shares of
common stock by the selling stockholders. One of the selling stockholders owns a
majority of the shares of our outstanding common stock and is also an affiliate
of Credit Suisse First Boston, one of the underwriters of this offering.

    We plan to use $70.0 million of our net proceeds from this offering to repay
a portion of the term loan under our credit facility. We will use approximately
$2.5 million of the proceeds to repurchase 135,326 shares of our common stock at
the initial public offering price, less underwriting discounts and commissions,
from nine officers on the closing date of this offering. We will use the
remaining $19.3 million for working capital and general corporate purposes,
which may include cash payments made in connection with future acquisitions. We
do not currently have any pending agreements or letters of intent for any
significant acquisitions.

    Our current senior credit facility consists of a $50 million revolving
credit facility and a term loan facility of $170 million. As of September 30,
2005, we had $161.3 million of indebtedness outstanding under the term loan
portion of our senior credit facility. The term loan bears interest at either a
base rate plus 2.0%, or the London Interbank Offered Rate (""LIBOR"") plus 3.0%,
and becomes due and payable in October 2009. As of September 30, 2005, we had no
indebtedness outstanding under our revolving credit facility, other than
$9.6 million of stand-by letters of credit. Our borrowings under the term loan
and revolving credit facility were used to refinance existing debt and to
provide for ongoing working capital and general corporate purposes, including
acquisitions of new well servicing rigs, acquisitions of businesses (including
our October 2005 acquisition of Oilwell Fracturing Services, Inc.) and capital
leases issued for equipment.

    We will repurchase an aggregate of 135,326 shares from the nine officers to
provide such officers the cash amounts necessary to pay certain tax liabilities
associated with the vesting of restricted shares owned by them. The shares being
repurchased represent up to 39.2% of the vested shares of each officer issued as
compensation to them. We will withhold minimum tax liability requirements from
these proceeds and pay the remainder of the proceeds to the officers for their
use in paying estimated tax liabilities. The executive officers and number of
shares that we will repurchase upon the closing of this offering are as follows:
Kenneth V. Huseman—101,975 shares; James J. Carter—10,005 shares; Dub W.
Harrison—11,184 shares; and Charles W. Swift—4,161 shares."

approximately $64.2 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment
option in full, based upon the initial public offering price of $15.00 per
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

    We estimate that we will use:

   •  approximately $17.0 million of our net proceeds to expand our sales,        
      marketing and distribution capabilities; and

    We intend to use the remainder of our net proceeds for general corporate
purposes. We may use a portion of our net proceeds to acquire complementary
products, technologies or businesses. We currently have no agreements or
commitments to complete any such transactions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending upon numerous factors,
including our future revenues and cash generated by operations. Accordingly, we
will retain broad discretion in the allocation of our net proceeds of this
offering.

    Pending use of our net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.

    We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of class A common
stock offered by El.En."

will be approximately US$40 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated expenses payable by us. If the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net proceeds to us would be
approximately US$50 million. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the
sale of the ADSs by the selling shareholders, including proceeds from the sale
of ADSs by Melody Share Corporation, a Cayman Islands company, which is
consolidated into our financial statements. The proceeds received by Melody
Share Corporation will be used exclusively to (i) repay Melody Share
Corporation’s short-term debt, (ii) satisfy Melody Share Corporation’s VSO Cash
Rights and KSO Cancellee Cash Rights liabilities and (iii) pay certain legal and
other expenses.

    We expect to use the proceeds from this offering primarily to strengthen our
global market position by expanding into new markets in which we have limited or
no presence (including but not limited to Europe and China) either through
opening of new offices or acquisitions. In addition, we may look at acquisitions
in some of our existing markets.

    Other uses of proceeds will likely include increased investment in research
and development for new products and services, capital expenditures where
needed, and general corporate purposes.

    The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on several
factors, including the amount of cash generated or used by our ongoing
operations. We have neither determined the timing of the expenditures nor the
amounts to be expended in any specific area. Pending their use, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in low-yielding bank deposits or other short-term
securities which are not considered to be investment securities."

and the estimated offering expenses payable by us, are estimated to be
approximately $93.8 million, or $113.0 million if the underwriters' option to
purchase additional ADSs is exercised in full at an assumed public offering
price of $19.64 per ADS, the closing price of our shares on the Bombay Stock
Exchange Limited on November 14, 2005 and adjusted to account for the ratio of
two equity shares per ADS. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale
of ADSs by the selling shareholders.

    We intend to use all of the net proceeds that we receive for the
construction and development of new infrastructure facilities at our offshore
locations in India. We have begun to implement an expansion plan that involves
building, over the next three years, two new knowledge parks in Navi Mumbai and
Chennai, new and expanded facilities in Bangalore and Hyderabad and improved
facilities at several of our other locations in India. We anticipate that
expenditures for these facilities will total approximately $250 million to
$300 million through 2007. See ""Business-Facilities and Infrastructure."" We plan
to fund this expansion from a combination of cash on hand, the net proceeds from
this offering and cash generated from future operations. As of September 30,
2005, we had approximately $164.4 million in cash and cash equivalents
(including short term investments available for use for these purposes).

    To the extent the net proceeds from this offering are not immediately
applied for the above purpose, we plan to invest such proceeds in short-term
securities, including units of liquid mutual funds in India, units of other debt
mutual funds or short-term and interest-bearing securities such as U.S.
government securities."

from the sale of our common stock in this offering, at an assumed initial public
offering price of $10.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the
underwriters exercise the over-allotment option in whole or in part, we will not
receive any of the proceeds from the sale of those shares by the selling
stockholders.

  The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future access
to the public equity markets.

  We currently intend to use a portion of the net proceeds from this offering to
repay outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility, which accrues interest
at the bank's prime rate, which was 6.75% as of September 30, 2005, and will
mature in October 2007. The amount outstanding under our credit facility was
approximately $6.8 million at September 30, 2005. The actual amount we repay
will be based upon the amount outstanding upon the consummation of this
offering. We currently intend to use the remaining proceeds for general
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, but we
have not designated any specific uses. We may use a portion of the net proceeds
from this offering to finance our growth strategy, including our planned
expansion of our distribution channels, sales force, international market
penetration and business operations and solution offerings generally, if our
available cash from operating activities is insufficient to finance these
expansion efforts. However, we currently have no plans to do so. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions
of, complementary businesses, solutions or technologies. We have no current
agreements or commitments with respect to any investment or acquisition. In
addition, the amount and timing of what we actually spend for these purposes may
vary significantly and will depend on a number of factors, including our future
revenue and cash generated by operations and the other factors described in
""Risk Factors."" Accordingly, our management will have discretion and flexibility
in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending any uses, as described
above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high quality, investment grade,
short-term fixed income instruments which include corporate, financial
institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations."
"DCP MIDSTREAM, LP",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/dcp-midstream-lp-685590-46501,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/dcp-midstream-lp-685590-46501,424B4,12/2/2005,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=4052926,"We expect to receive net proceeds of approximately $180.9 million from the
sale of 9,000,000 common units offered by this prospectus, after deducting
underwriting discounts and a structuring fee but before paying offering
expenses. We base this amount on the initial public offering price of $21.50 per
common unit and assume no exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional common units. We anticipate using the aggregate net proceeds of this
offering to:

   •  purchase $73.0 million of United States Treasury and other qualifying       
      securities, which will be assigned as collateral to secure the term loan    
      portion of our credit facility;                                             
  
   •  pay approximately $4.7 million of expenses associated with the offering and 
      related formation transactions;                                             
  
   •  use approximately $53.9 million to fund payables;                           
  
   •  distribute approximately $8.6 million in cash to subsidiaries of Duke Energy
      Field Services as reimbursement for capital expenditures incurred by        
      subsidiaries of Duke Energy Field Services prior to this offering related to
      the assets to be contributed to us upon the closing of this offering, which 
      distribution will be made in partial consideration of the assets contributed
      to us upon the closing of this offering; and                                
  
   •  use the remaining proceeds of approximately $40.7 million to fund future    
      capital expenditures (including potential acquisitions), working capital and
      other general partnership purposes.                                       

    We also anticipate that we borrow approximately $110.0 million under our
revolving credit facility and approximately $73.0 million under our term loan
facility upon the closing of this offering, and we will distribute the aggregate
amount of the proceeds of such borrowings to subsidiaries of Duke Energy Field
Services, which distribution will be made in partial consideration of the assets
contributed to us upon the closing of this offering. 

    The anticipated borrowing of approximately $73.0 million under the term loan
facility upon the closing of this offering and the use of an equal amount of net
proceeds of this offering to purchase United States Treasury and other
qualifying securities will enable us to make a tax efficient distribution to
affiliates of Duke Energy Field Services. The United States Treasury and other
qualifying securities purchased will be assigned as collateral to secure the
term loan borrowings. The interest we receive from our ownership of these United
States Treasury and other qualifying securities will partially offset our cost
of borrowings under the term loan facility.

    If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units is
exercised, we will (1) use the net proceeds from the sale of these additional
units to purchase an equivalent amount of United States Treasury and other
qualifying securities and (2) borrow an additional amount under the term loan
facility equal to the net proceeds to be received from the exercise of the
underwriters’ option. The United States Treasury and other qualifying securities
purchased will be assigned as collateral to secure the term loan borrowings. The
proceeds of the additional term loan borrowings will be used to redeem from a
subsidiary of Duke Energy Field Services a number of common units equal to the
number of common units issued upon exercise of the underwriters’ option, at a
price per common unit equal to the proceeds per common unit before expenses but
after underwriting discounts and a structuring fee.

    If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units is exercised
in full, we would receive approximately $27.1 million of net proceeds from the
sale of these common units and, accordingly, we would use this amount to
purchase United States Treasury and other qualifying securities, and we would
borrow an equal amount under our term loan facility, which borrowings would be
used to redeem common units as described above."
