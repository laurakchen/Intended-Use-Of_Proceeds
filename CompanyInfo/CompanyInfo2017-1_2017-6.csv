of the common stock offered by us after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds we receive from this offering to
fully repay the outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility, which was
$132.0 million as of December 31, 2016. We intend to fund our $580.0 million
2017 capital program with cash flow from operations, the remaining approximately
$265.1 million of net proceeds from this offering and borrowings under our
credit facility.

Our credit facility matures on June 19, 2020, and bears interest at a variable
rate. At December 31, 2016, the weighted average interest rate on borrowings
under our credit facility was 3.99%. We also pay a commitment fee on unused
amounts of our credit facility of 0.500%. The outstanding borrowings under our
credit facility were incurred to fund a portion of our 2015 and 2016 capital
expenditures, as well as general and administrative expenses. We may at any time
reborrow amounts repaid under our credit facility, and we expect to do so in the
future to fund our capital program. In connection with this offering, we will
amend and restate our credit facility to, among other things, extend the
maturity date to on or around the fifth anniversary of the consummation of this
offering.

An affiliate of one of the underwriters is a lender under our existing credit
facility and will receive 5% or more of the net proceeds of this offering due to
the repayment of borrowings thereunder. Accordingly, this offering is being made
in compliance with FINRA Rule 5121."
"JELD-WEN HOLDING, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/jeldwen-holding-inc-995860-81017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/jeldwen-holding-inc-995860-81017,424B4,1/30/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11809654,"The net proceeds to us from our sale of 22,272,727 shares of common stock in
this offering will be approximately $472.8 million, after deducting underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any
of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock sold by the selling
stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to repay indebtedness as described
below, increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public
market for our common stock, enable access to the public equity markets for us
and our stockholders, and increase our visibility in the marketplace. We intend
to use the net proceeds that we receive from this offering to repay
approximately $375 million of indebtedness outstanding under our Term Loan
Facility. We will use remaining net proceeds to us for working capital and other
general corporate purposes, including sales and marketing activities, general
and administrative matters, and capital expenditures. We may also use a portion
of the net proceeds to invest in or acquire complementary businesses, products,
services, technologies, or other assets. We will have broad discretion in using
these proceeds. Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest net
proceeds to us in short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
instruments, certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government.

In November 2016, we borrowed an incremental $375 million under our Term Loan
Facility. We used the proceeds thereof, together with cash on hand and
borrowings under our ABL Facility, to make payments of approximately $400
million to holders of our outstanding common stock, Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock, Class B-1 Common Stock, options, and RSUs, as well as to pay
related fees and expenses. As of November 1, 2016, our Term Loan Facility bore
interest at LIBOR (subject to a floor of 1.00%) plus a margin of 3.75%. The Term
Loan Facility matures on July 1, 2022."
"JOUNCE THERAPEUTICS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/jounce-therapeutics-inc-963995-82496,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/jounce-therapeutics-inc-963995-82496,424B4,1/27/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11806442,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in
this offering will be approximately $92.8 million, or $107.0 million if the
underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares,
assuming an initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, and after 
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to access the public capital markets
and to increase our liquidity. We anticipate that we will use the net proceeds
received by us in this offering, together with our existing cash, cash
equivalents, and marketable securities, as follows:

• approximately $30.0 million to advance JTX-2011 through the completion of our 
  multi-arm Phase I/II clinical trial, designed to provide safety and dosing 
  data, and clinical proof of concept efficacy data for JTX-2011 both as a 
  single agent and in combination with other therapies;

• approximately $25.0 million to advance JTX-4014 through Investigational New
  Drug, or IND, enabling studies and filings, and planned initial clinical
  studies for development as a combination agent;

• approximately $10.0 million to continue to advance and expand our 
  Translational Science Platform, and research and development pipeline,
  including both internal and external costs for IND enabling studies and early
  discovery efforts, including our beyond T effector cell activities; and

• use the remainder for working capital and other general corporate purposes,
  which will include hiring of additional personnel, capital expenditures and
  the costs of operating as a public company.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents, and
marketable securities, together with the net proceeds to us from this offering,
will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least twenty-four months.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date
of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses
for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the extent of clinical development may
vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development efforts, the status of and results from preclinical studies or
clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as our existing
collaboration with Celgene and any other collaborations that we may enter into
with third parties for JTX-2011, JTX-4014 or any future product candidates or
business development opportunities we may engage in for our programs and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion
over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in high-quality,
investment-grade, short-term fixed income instruments, which include corporate,
financial institution, federal agency or U.S. government obligations."

shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $254.8 million,
after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholders if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of common stock.

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• first, to redeem in full our outstanding Senior Secured Notes and pay the 
  related call premium, which would have matured on November 1, 2019 and bore 
  interest at a fixed rate of 8.500% per annum, and to pay accrued and unpaid 
  interest thereon from the most recent interest payment date to the redemption
  date, for a total redemption price of approximately $192.1 million; and 

• second, to use the remaining proceeds, if any, to repay approximately up to 
  $62.6 million aggregate principal amount of loans under the ABL Facility, 
  which matures on October 21, 2018 and bears interest at a base or LIBOR rate,
  as defined in the ABL Facility, plus a spread of 175 basis points (a weighted
  average rate of 2.2% on borrowings outstanding as of October 29, 2016), and to
  pay accrued and unpaid interest thereon from the most recent interest payment
  date to the repayment date.
   
Pending the use of proceeds described above, we may invest the net proceeds in
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing securities such as money market
accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper, or guaranteed obligations
of the U.S. government.

Because an affiliate of Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. is a lender under the ABL
Facility and will receive 5% or more of the net proceeds received by us from
this offering, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. is deemed to have a “conflict of
interest” under FINRA Rule 5121. As a result, this offering will be conducted in
accordance with FINRA Rule 5121."

we are offering will be $86.8 million, based on the initial public offering
price of $15.00 per common share, after deducting the underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

• approximately $49.0 million to advance the development of OBE2109;

• approximately $11.0 million to advance the development of OBE001;

• approximately $8.0 million to advance the development of OBE022; and

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, as well as 
  for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including to pursue
  our strategy to in-license or acquire additional product candidates, although
  we have no agreements or commitments for any specific acquisitions or 
  in-licenses as of the date of this prospectus.            

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash and
cash equivalents represents our intentions based upon our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
development, the status of and results from clinical trials, as well as any
collaborations that we may enter into with third parties for our product
candidates, and any unforeseen cash needs.

As a result, our management will have broad discretion in the application of the
net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment
of our management regarding the application of those net proceeds. Pending these
uses, we plan to invest these net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing
deposits.

Based on the planned use of proceeds described above, we believe that the net
proceeds from this offering and our current cash and cash equivalents will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements for more than 12 months. We anticipate these funds will be
sufficient for the completion of our Phase 2b clinical trial of OBE2109 in
patients with endometriosis, the initiation of our two Phase 3 clinical trials
of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids, the initiation and completion of
our European Phase 3 clinical trial of OBE001 in women undergoing IVF and the
completion of our Phase 1 and DDI clinical trials and the subsequent initiation
and completion of a Phase 2 clinical trial of OBE022 for the treatment of
preterm labor. We anticipate that we will need additional funds to complete our
two Phase 3 clinical trials of OBE2109 in patients with uterine fibroids. We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect."

stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of $15.00 per share,
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses payable by us, will be approximately $65.8 million, or $76.2 million if
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows: 

• approximately $25.0 million to fund development of ANB020 and ANB019 through 
  initial clinical trials intended to demonstrate efficacy in multiple 
  indications; 

• approximately $15.0 million to fund continued development of other 
  wholly-owned product candidates, including our checkpoint receptor agonist 
  antibodies, and discovery of new product candidates to further expand our
  proprietary pipeline; and 

• any remaining amounts to fund working capital, including general corporate 
  purposes.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds, we estimate such funds, together
with our existing cash and cash equivalents, will be sufficient for us to fund
our operating expenses and capital expenditure requirements through at least the
next 24 months.

The expected use of the net proceeds from the offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with any certainty all of the particular uses for
the net proceeds or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set
forth above. We may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of, or
investment in, technologies, solutions or businesses that complement our
business, although we have no present commitments or agreements.

The amounts and timing of our clinical expenditures and the extent of clinical
development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
status, results and timing of our current preclinical studies and clinical
trials we may commence in the future, product approval process with the FDA and
other regulatory agencies, our current collaborations and any new collaborations
we may enter into with third parties and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result,
our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net
proceeds from this offering.

The expected net proceeds of this offering will not be sufficient for us to fund
any of our product candidates through regulatory approval, and we will need to
raise substantial additional capital to complete the development and
commercialization of our product candidates.

Pending their use as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from
this offering in short term, investment-grade interest-bearing securities such
as money market accounts, certificates of deposit, commercial paper and
guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) As of the date of this prospectus, $231,846 of these expenses have been paid
    from the proceeds of loans made to us by our sponsor. These loans by our 
    sponsor will be repaid upon the earlier of the completion of this offering
    or June 30, 2017. If offering expenses actually paid are less than the 
    estimates set forth in this table, the balance will be used for post-closing
    working capital.

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer until consummation of our initial 
    business combination $7.65 million of their underwriting commissions (or 
    approximately $9.26 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is 
    exercised in full), which equals 5.0% of the gross proceeds from the units
    sold to the public, excluding any units purchased pursuant to the 
    underwriters’ overallotment option, and 7.0% of the gross proceeds from the
    units sold to the public pursuant to the underwriters’ overallotment option.
    Upon consummation of our initial business combination, the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in
    the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or 
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on 
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination, 
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital.

(3) $153.0 million from the proceeds of this offering and the private placement
    ($175.95 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment option in
    full), including deferred underwriting commissions of $7.65 million 
    (approximately $9.26 million if the underwriters exercise their 
    overallotment option in full), will be placed in a trust account held at 
    JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., located in the United States, with Continental 
    Stock Transfer & Trust Company, acting as trustee.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    If we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry subject to 
    industry specific regulation, we may incur additional expenses associated 
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary, and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. We are also
    entitled to pay our franchise and income taxes, up to $500,000 of working 
    capital expenses and up to $100,000 of dissolution expenses from interest 
    earned on the trust account.

(5) To the extent that we need working capital in excess of the net proceeds 
    from this offering and the private placement held out of trust and the 
    amounts of interest available to us from the trust account, our sponsor has
    committed to lend us the necessary funds, up to a maximum of $1,100,000. The
    loans will be interest free, due and payable upon completion of our initial 
    business combination and convertible into warrants of the post business 
    combination entity at a price of $0.75 per one-half of one warrant at the 
    option of the lender.

A total of $153.0 million (or $175.95 million if the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full) of the aggregate net proceeds from
this offering and the private placement, including $7.65 million (or
approximately $9.26 million if the underwriters exercise their overallotment
option in full) of the deferred underwriting discount, will be placed in a trust
account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and
will be invested only in United States government treasury bills with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds investing solely in United States
Treasuries and meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment
Company Act. Except for any interest income released to us to pay our franchise
and income taxes and up to $500,000 for working capital purposes, none of the
funds held in the trust account will be released, subject to the requirements of
law, until the earlier of (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or if our board of directors resolves to liquidate the trust account
and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination prior to the
expiration of the 24 month period (our board of directors may determine to
liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it determines, in its
business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining time to identify
an attractive business combination or satisfy regulatory and other business and
legal requirements to consummate a business combination).

The net proceeds held in the trust account (excluding any deferred underwriting
commissions) may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target
business with which we ultimately complete a business combination. If we pay for
our initial business combination using stock or debt securities, or if we do not
use all of the funds released from the trust account for payment of the 
purchase price in connection with our business combination, we may use the 
remaining cash released from the trust account for general corporate purposes, 
including for maintenance or expansion of the operations of acquired businesses,
the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in 
consummating the initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other 
companies or for working capital.

We believe that the net proceeds from this offering and the private placement
held out of trust, interest income on the amount in the trust account that may
be released to fund working capital requirements and amounts which our sponsor
has committed to lend to us for working capital prior to our initial business
combination will be sufficient to pay our costs and expenses prior to our
initial business combination. This belief is based on the fact that while we may
begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in connection with an
indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due diligence, depending
on the circumstances of the relevant prospective acquisition, only after we have
negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that
addresses the terms of a business combination. However, if our estimate of the
costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional
capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management
team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to
advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Our sponsor, FinTech Investor Holdings II, LLC, has committed to loan us up to
an aggregate of $500,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this
offering ($231,846 of which has been loaned as of the date of this prospectus).
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of June
30, 2017 or the completion of this offering. In addition, in order to fund
transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business combination,
our sponsor has committed to loan us funds as may be required up to a maximum of
$1,100,000, which will be repaid only upon the consummation of an initial
business combination. If we do not consummate an initial business combination,
we may use a portion of any working capital held outside the trust account to
repay such loaned amounts; however, no proceeds from the trust account may be
used for such repayment, other than up to $500,000 of interest income earned
thereon. If such funds are insufficient to repay the loan amounts, the unpaid
amounts would be forgiven. Any part or all of such loans may be converted into
additional warrants at $0.75 per one-half of one warrant (warrants to purchase a
maximum of 733,333 whole shares if the full $1,100,000 is loaned and that amount
is converted into warrants) of the post-business combination entity at the
option of our sponsor. The warrants would be identical to the placement warrants
issued to our sponsor.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our initial holders, directors, officers or their
respective affiliates may purchase shares in the open market or in privately
negotiated transactions either prior to or following the consummation of our
initial business combination, although as of the date of this prospectus (apart
from the purchase of the placement units) they have no commitments, plans or
intentions to engage in such transactions. If they do effect such purchases, we
anticipate that they would approach a limited number of large holders of our
securities that have voted against the business combination or sought redemption
of their shares, or that have indicated an intention to do so, and engage in
direct negotiations for the purchase of such holders’ positions. All holders
approached in this manner would be institutional or sophisticated holders. There
is no limit on the number of shares they may acquire. Our initial holders,
directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material nonpublic information not
disclosed to the seller or during a restricted period under Regulation M under
the Exchange Act or in transactions that would violate Section 9(a)(2) or Rule
10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act. Although they do not currently anticipate paying
any premium purchase price for such public shares, there is no limit on the
price they may pay. They may also enter into transactions to provide such
holders with incentives to acquire shares or vote their shares in favor of an
initial business combination. We will notify stockholders of such material
purchases or arrangements that would affect the vote on an initial business
combination, if any, by press release, filing a Form 8-K or by means of a
supplement to our proxy statement. No funds in the trust account may be used to
effect purchases of shares in the open market or in privately negotiated
transactions.
                   
In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination. Moreover, the redemption threshold may be further limited
by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination. If the amount
of redemptions plus any cash required by our initial business combination would
cause our net tangible assets to fall below $5,000,000, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
consummate a business combination within 24 months from the completion of this
offering (excluding any exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option),
subject to applicable law; (iii) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any
exercise of the underwriters’ overallotment option); or (iv) otherwise upon our
liquidation or in the event our board of directors resolves to liquidate the
trust account and ceases to pursue the consummation of a business combination
prior to the expiration of the 24 month period (our board of directors may
determine to liquidate the trust account prior to such expiration if it
determines, in its business judgment, that it is improbable within the remaining
time that we will be able to identify an attractive acquisition target or
satisfy regulatory and other business and legal requirements to consummate a
business combination). In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

The initial holders and Cantor Fitzgerald have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares and placement shares (i) in
connection with the consummation of a business combination, (ii) in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100%
of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the completion of this offering (excluding any exercise of
the underwriters’ overallotment option) and (iii) if we fail to consummate a
business combination within the 24 month period or if we liquidate prior to the
expiration of the 24 month period. The initial holders have also agreed to waive
their redemption rights with respect to public shares in connection with the
consummation of a business combination or a stockholder vote to amend our
amended and restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete our initial business combination within the 24 month period. However,
if the initial holders, or any of our officers, directors or affiliates,
acquires public shares, they will be entitled to redemption rights with respect
to such public shares if we fail to consummate our initial business combination
or liquidate within the required time period. In addition, Cantor Fitzgerald
will have the same redemption rights as a public stockholder with respect to any
public shares it acquires. Cantor Fitzgerald has informed us that it has no
current commitments, plans or intentions to acquire any public shares for its
own account; however, if Cantor Fitzgerald does acquire public shares, it will
do so in the ordinary course of its business. Cantor Fitzgerald will not make 
any such purchases when it is in possession of any material nonpublic 
information not disclosed to the seller, during a  restricted period under
Regulation M under the Exchange Act, in transactions that would violate Section
9(a)(2) or Rule 10(b)-5 under the Exchange Act, or if prohibited by applicable 
state securities laws or broker-dealer regulations."

$259.3 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and
approximately $6.0 million of our estimated expenses related to this offering
(or approximately $254.3 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option to purchase additional shares from the selling stockholder
in full).

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
stockholder, including pursuant to any exercise by the underwriters of their
over-allotment option to purchase additional shares of our common stock from the
selling stockholder, but we will be required to pay the underwriting discounts
and commissions associated with such sales of shares. Pursuant to an
over-allotment option, the selling stockholder has offered to sell up to
4,014,000 shares of our common stock in this offering.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to fully repay our existing
balance of approximately $99 million under our Existing Term Loan Facility (and,
in addition, approximately $16 million of prepayment premium related to such
repayment), repay approximately $50 million of our Notes and to pay fees and
expenses related to this offering. We intend to use any remaining proceeds for
general corporate purposes, which may include the repayment of indebtedness,
capital expenditures, working capital and potential acquisitions and strategic
transactions.

The principal amount outstanding under the Existing Term Loan Facility currently
bears interest, at our option, at a rate per annum equal to either (a) the base
rate plus 6.00% or (b) LIBOR (subject to a 1.50% floor for any portion of the
term loan subject to an interest period of three or six months) plus 7.00%. The
final maturity date of the Existing Term Loan Facility is the earlier to occur
of (a) March 16, 2021 and (b) to the extent the obligations under the NPA (as
defined herein) mature on or prior to March 16, 2021, the date that is 91 days
prior to the earlier of (i) March 16, 2021 and (ii) the date of the maturity of
the obligations under the NPA. Proceeds from the Existing Term Loan Facility
were used to partially finance the Trican transaction.

The Notes bear interest at a rate per annum equal to 12.00%. The Notes mature on
August 8, 2019. The proceeds from the 2014 issuance of the Notes were used to
refinance existing indebtedness and fund additional investment in hydraulic
fracturing and wireline equipment.

Affiliates of Guggenheim Securities, LLC are holders of the Notes and may
receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering that are used to repay the
Notes."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their 
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.
       
(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. On each
    of August 19, 2016 and January 11, 2017, we borrowed $150,000 under the 
    promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses
    of this offering. The $300,000 will be repaid upon completion of this 
    offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated
    for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting commissions)
    and amounts not to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering
    expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be 
    used for post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the
    offering expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund 
    such excess with funds not held in the trust account.

(3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $13,125,000, which constitutes the underwriter's
    deferred commissions (or $15,093,750 if the underwriter's over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriter from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business 
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.
   
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this 
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private 
placement warrants, $375,000,000 (or $431,250,000 if the underwriter's 
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $13,125,000 (or
$15,093,750 if the underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at Deutsche Bank Trust Company Americas, with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the
interest earned on the trust account will be approximately $750,000 per year,
assuming an interest rate of 0.2% per year. Except with respect to interest
earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to fund
our Regulatory Withdrawals and/or to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months 
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on assumed interest 
rates, we expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of income
taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs 
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due 
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or 
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office space, utilities and se
cretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. On each of
August 19, 2016 and January 11, 2017, we borrowed $150,000 under the promissory
note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of 
January 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon
the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held
in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private 
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We 
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such 
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds
in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in 
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to 
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of 
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our 
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

common stock offered by us will be approximately $68.1 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us. If the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares in this
offering is exercised in full, we estimate that our net proceeds will be
approximately $78.8 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and expenses.

We intend to use all or a portion of the net proceeds of this offering, together
with cash on hand, which was $41.6 million at September 30, 2016, pro forma for
the refinancing of Tribeca House debt on November 9, 2016 and refund of an
acquisition deposit on November 14, 2016 (actual amount as of that date was
$82.1 million), to (i) fund approximately $46 million of certain capital
improvements to reposition and modernize our properties, including the Columbia
Heights property, and (ii) fund acquisitions of properties consistent with our
strategy of acquiring multi-family or commercial properties in the New York
metropolitan area, including the Columbia Heights acquisition. Pending
application of the net proceeds, we will invest the net proceeds in short-term,
interest-bearing securities that are consistent with our election to be taxed as
a REIT for U.S. federal income tax purposes. Such investments may include
obligations of the Government National Mortgage Association, other government
agency securities, certificates of deposit, and interest-bearing bank deposits. 

We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of our common
stock by the selling stockholders. However, we have agreed to pay all expenses
relating to the registration of the shares sold by the selling stockholders,
other than any brokers’ or underwriters’ discounts and commissions."

Pending use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we may
invest the net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing 
obligations, investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or
guaranteed obligations of the United States government.

The selling stockholder will receive approximately $25.4 million in net proceeds
from this offering if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by
the selling stockholder.

An affiliate of RBC Capital Markets, LLC is a lender under the ABL Credit

shares in this offering will be approximately $11.2 million (or approximately
$13.0 million if the representative exercises its over-allotment option in 
full), after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purpose of this offering is to raise additional funds to increase
our loan portfolio. As a real estate finance company whose primary source of
income is interest generated from our loan portfolio, the only way for us to
increase our revenue is to increase the size of our loan portfolio.

The table below sets forth our expected use of the net proceeds from this
offering represents our intentions based upon our current plans and business
conditions.

Funding loans. Approximately $11.0 million, or 98.2%, of the net proceeds of
this offering will be used to fund new loans and grow our loan portfolio.

Capital expenditures. We plan to make various renovations to the building we
purchased on Main Street in Branford, Connecticut that will serve as our new
corporate headquarters. We estimate the cost of the renovations will be
approximately $125,000.

Working capital. As a result of our conversion to REIT status and the
consummation of this offering we expect that our general and administrative
expenses, such as compensation and other employee-related expenses, insurance,
rent, legal and accounting, will increase on account of our various reporting
and compliance obligations and our expanded operations.

We may also use the net proceeds to pay down, on a temporary basis, the
outstanding balance on the Bankwell Credit Line.

Pending the application of any portion of the net proceeds, we may invest such
funds in interest bearing accounts and short-term, interest bearing securities
that are consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT and maintain our
exemption from registration under the Investment Company Act. These investments
are expected to provide lower returns than those we will seek to achieve from
our loan portfolio."

of the common stock offered by us after deducting underwriting discounts and

any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use approximately $10.7 million of such proceeds to pay in full our
four-year promissory note due to Ramaco, LLC in the principal amount of
approximately $10.6 million, plus accrued interest. While the remainder of the
net proceeds of this offering have not yet been allocated to a specific purpose,
we have identified a number of projects to which we anticipate allocating such
proceeds, including (i) development of our Knox Creek mine (the mine plan for
which is not yet finalized), (ii) deployment of capital at Elk Creek to
construct additional logistics infrastructure to enhance efficiencies at that
project, (iii) expanding our Knox Creek preparation plant to capture market
opportunities related to acquiring coal from third parties, and washing and
selling that coal for our own account and (iv) acquiring coal mines that are in
close proximity to our current projects. We have not yet made final investment
decisions with respect to any of these potential projects and we cannot
currently allocate specific percentages of the net proceeds that we may use for
the purposes described above. Until we use our net proceeds of the offering, we
intend to invest the funds in United States government securities and other
short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments or high-grade
corporate notes.

On August 31, 2016, Ramaco Development entered into a negotiable promissory note
with Ramaco, LLC, in the principal amount of $10.6 million. Interest accrues at
a rate of 1.82% per annum and payments are due in three installments to
reimburse Ramaco, LLC for amounts it loaned to Ramaco Development for
development and overhead expenses incurred by Ramaco Development prior to this
Offering. Subject to certain conditions, the note matures on December 31, 2020.
As of November 30, 2016, the remaining principal balance of the promissory note
is $10.6 million. The note will be repaid in full with a portion of the net
proceeds of this offering.

The expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. We believe the
net proceeds from this offering, together with our current cash and investments,
and projected cash flow from future operations will be sufficient to fund our
projected capital expenditures. However, the amounts and timing of our actual
expenditures depend on numerous factors, including the progress of development
of our properties, which involves numerous uncertainties. Accordingly, we may 
choose to reallocate or otherwise use the proceeds from this offering and will
have broad discretion in the use of the net proceeds from this offering."

credit facility. We will not assume any indebtedness of our predecessor in 
connection with this offering.

To the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
common units, we will issue such units to the public and distribute the net
proceeds to the Contributing Parties. Any common units not purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to their option will be issued to the Contributing Parties
at the expiration of the option period for no additional consideration. If the
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional common units in full,
the additional net proceeds to us would be approximately $12.6 million, after
deducting the underwriting discount and structuring fee. We will use any net
proceeds from the exercise of the underwriters' option to purchase additional
common units from us to make an additional cash distribution to the Contributing
Parties."

40,250,000 shares if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares of Class A common stock) of our Class A common stock being
offered by us pursuant to this prospectus at the initial public offering price
of $14.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately
$456.5 million (or $526.3 million if the underwriters exercise in full their
option to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay, redeem or
repurchase our outstanding Senior Notes, our term loans under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities and/or the seller notes used to partially finance the
acquisition of FMU Group. We have not yet determined whether we will repay the
Senior Notes through tender offers, open market repurchases or redemption. If
the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional shares of
Class A common stock, we intend to use such proceeds for general corporate
purposes, including the further repayment, redemption or repurchase of certain
of our indebtedness.

As of September 30, 2016, there was approximately $1.4 billion aggregate
principal amount of Senior Notes outstanding, which bear interest at a rate of
9.250% per annum and mature on September 1, 2019. As of the date of this
prospectus, we have not caused a registration statement to be declared effective
to complete the registration requirement for an exchange offer for our Senior
Notes. Accordingly, special interest is accruing on such indebtedness at a rate
equal to 0.75% per annum. There is approximately $1.5 billion of term loans
outstanding under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities with approximately
$282.6 million outstanding that have a maturity date of June 16, 2018, which as
of September 30, 2016, bears interest at a rate of 5.0% per annum. Upon the
closing and funding of the purchase price of the Series A Preferred Stock
offering in full, which was a qualified equity issuance under our Senior Secured
Credit Facilities, the applicable LIBOR margin for the 2021 Extended Term Loan
under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was reduced to 7.5% and the
applicable ABR margin was reduced to 6.5%. The applicable LIBOR margin for the
revolving credit line under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities was reduced to
3.75% and the applicable ABR margin was reduced to 2.75%. In addition, the
additional scheduled payment on such 2021 Extended Term Loan in the amount of
$62.5 million will not be required under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities.
The FMU seller notes have an outstanding balance of $97.6 million, mature on
September 12, 2017, and bear interest of approximately 14% based on the
Certificados de Depositos Interbancarios (""CDI"") rate, a published index, as of
September 30, 2016.

Affiliates of certain of the underwriters hold a portion of the Senior Notes
and/or the term loans under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities, and as a
result, may receive a portion of the proceeds from this offering."

(1) Includes gross proceeds from this offering of $350,000,000 (or $402,500,000 
    if the underwriter’s overallotment option is exercised in full) as well as  
    amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their shares in  
    connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans  
    from our sponsor of up to $300,000 as described in this prospectus. As of   
    December 31, 2016, we had borrowed $20,000 (of up to $300,000 available to  
    us) under the promissory note with our sponsor to be used for a portion of  
    the expenses of this offering. These amounts will be repaid upon completion 
    of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been     
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses (other than underwriting     
    commissions). In the event that offering expenses are more than as set forth
    in this table, they will be repaid using a portion of the $1,250,000 of     
    offering proceeds not held in the trust account and set aside for           
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that offering expenses  
    are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for    
    post-closing working capital expenses.                                      

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, $12,250,000, which constitutes the underwriters’      
    deferred commissions (or $14,087,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment    
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be released to us   
    and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the        
    business or businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or
    for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest  
    on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business            
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on   
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                        

(4) These expenses are estimates only and do not include interest which may be  
    available to us from the trust account. Our actual expenditures for some or 
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For      
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business       
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific        
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses  
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal     
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may   
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due       
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, 
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, 
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any     
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.     

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for  
    financing.                                                                  

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $350,000,000 (or $402,500,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $12,250,000 (or $14,087,500 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with American Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as
trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $1,225,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.35% per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the
funds held in the trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise
and income tax obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the
private placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or 
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are 
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business 
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust 
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion 
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or 
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business 
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective business
combination, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. As of
December 31, 2016, we had borrowed $20,000 under the promissory note with our
sponsor to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2017
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We
do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate
of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such
funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in
our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. There is no
limit on the number of shares our initial stockholders, directors, officers,
advisors or their affiliates may purchase in such transactions, subject to
compliance with applicable law and the rules of NASDAQ. However, they have no
current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have
not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. One purpose
and effect of any such transactions would be to seek to obtain the necessary
number of votes in favor of our initial business combination, as our sponsor,
directors and officers have agreed, pursuant to the letter agreement, to vote 
any founder shares held by them and any public shares purchased during or after
this offering (including in open market and privately negotiated transactions) 
in favor of our initial business combination. If they engage in such 
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such 
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not 
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender 
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a 
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination and after payment of underwriters’ fees and commissions (so
that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for
our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

stock in this offering will be approximately $114.2 million, based on the
initial public offering price of $14.00 per share and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is exercised in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately $131.8 million, after
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering
expenses.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock, and
enable access to the public equity markets for us and our stockholders, increase
awareness of our company, and improve our competitive position. We intend to use
the net proceeds that we receive from this offering for working capital and
other general corporate purposes, including research and development and sales
and marketing activities, general and administrative matters, and capital
expenditures. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in or
acquire complementary businesses, products, services, technologies, or other
assets. However, we do not have any agreements or commitments for any specific
acquisitions or investments at this time.

We currently have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds that we
receive from this offering. Accordingly, we will have broad discretion in using
these proceeds, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of the proceeds. Pending their use, we plan to invest
the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, commercial paper, and guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of a loan
    from our sponsor of $300,000 as described in this prospectus. This amount
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial
    business combination, $31,500,000, which constitutes the underwriters'
    deferred commissions (or $36,225,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment
    option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters from the funds
    held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less amounts released to
    the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be
    used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or
    businesses with which our initial business combination occurs or for general
    corporate purposes, including payment of principal or interest on
    indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business combination,
    to fund the purchases of other companies or for working capital. The 
    underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred
    underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a ""no shop"" provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $900,000,000 (or $1,035,000,000 if the underwriters'
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $31,500,000 (or
$36,225,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full) of
deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a U.S.-based trust account
at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $180,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.02% per year; however, we can provide no assurance regarding
this amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the
trust account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of: (a) the completion of our initial business combination,
(b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in connection with a
stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public
shares if we do not complete our initial business combination within 24 months
from the closing of this offering and (c) the redemption of our public shares if
we are unable to complete our business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering, subject to applicable law. Based on current interest
rates, we do not expect that the interest earned on the trust account, net of
income taxes, will be sufficient to pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective 
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the
earlier of March 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. The loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an 
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants, at a price of $1.50 per warrant at
the option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private
placement warrants, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise
period. The terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not
been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans.
Prior to the completion of our initial business combination, we do not expect to
seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as
we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a forward purchase agreement with Fund VI Holdings pursuant
to which it has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to 40,000,000 shares of
our Class A common stock, plus an aggregate of up to 13,333,333 warrants, for a
purchase price of $10.00 per forward purchase unit, or an aggregate purchase
price of up to $400,000,000 in a private placement that will close
simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. Fund VI
Holdings will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will result in
gross proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business
combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts
available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discount and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares) and any other
financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to the consummation
of our initial business combination, plus any additional amounts mutually agreed
by us and Fund VI Holdings to be retained by the post-business combination
company for working capital or other purposes. These purchases will be required
to be made regardless of whether any shares of Class A common stock are redeemed
by our public stockholders in connection with our initial business combination
and are intended to provide us with a minimum funding level for our initial
business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC's ""penny stock"" rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
our public shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within
24 months following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and
as further described herein and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with

common stock in this offering will be $48.3 million, based on the public 
offering price of $10.00 per share, after deducting the underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares from us is exercised in full,
we estimate that our net proceeds will be $55.6 million.

We currently anticipate that we will use approximately $38.0 million of the net
proceeds received by us to support ongoing sales and marketing activities for
V-Go and to expand our sales and marketing infrastructure. We anticipate we will
use approximately $10.0 million of the net proceeds received by us to fund
research, development and engineering activities and manufacturing capabilities,
which we expect to include the further development of our V-Go Prefill and V-Go
Link products, although we expect that we will need to seek additional capital
to complete their development and commercialization. We expect that the
remaining net proceeds will be used for working capital and other general
corporate purposes. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will
depend upon numerous factors, including the amount of cash generated by our
operations, our cash needs, the rate of adoption of our products by the medical
community and efficiency of our product development. We may find it necessary or
advisable to use portions of the proceeds from this offering for other purposes.

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous
factors. We therefore cannot estimate with certainty the amount of net proceeds
to be used for the purposes described above. We may find it necessary or 
advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad 
discretion in the application of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described 
above, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in short- and 
intermediate-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments, 
certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. 
government."

of ADSs offered by us in this offering (approximately $12 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full), based upon the
public offering price of $6.00 per ADS, and after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses.

We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for the following
purposes:

. Approximately $3.9 million to advance the formulation and clinical development
  efforts in our Joint Pharma program (THX-TS01 product candidate), allocated as
  follows:

. the remainder to fund general formulation development and product
  manufacturing for clinical trials.                                          

. Approximately $3.5 million to advance the formulation and clinical development
  efforts in our BrainBright Pharma program (THX- ULD01 product candidate),     
  allocated as follows:                                                         

. approximately $400,000 to complete a Phase I clinical trial in Canada or the

  manufacturing for clinical trials.                                         

. The remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, and possible
  in-licensing of additional intellectual property and product candidates.      

The amounts and schedule of our actual expenditures will depend on multiple
factors including the progress of our clinical development and regulatory
efforts, the status and results of the clinical trials, the pace of our
partnering efforts in regards to manufacturing and commercialization and the
overall regulatory environment. Therefore, our management will retain broad
discretion over the use of the proceeds from this offering. We may ultimately
use the proceeds for different purposes than what we currently intend. Pending
any ultimate use of any portion of the proceeds from this offering, if the
anticipated proceeds will not be sufficient to fund all the proposed purposes,
our management will determine the order of priority for using the proceeds, as
well as the amount and sources of other funds needed. 

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest the net
proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including short-term,
investment grade, interest bearing instruments and U.S. government securities."

plus 6.25% and is subject to a 1% floor. The outstanding borrowings under our
term loan were incurred primarily to fund a portion of our 2015 and 2016 capital
expenditures. In connection with the completion of this offering, we expect to

million, if the underwriters elect to exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares of common stock from us, after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this Offering as follows:

(a) We intend to use approximately $124.2 million of the net proceeds from this
    Offering to repurchase all of our outstanding Subordinated Notes, of which
    $111.8 million in aggregate principal amount are currently outstanding, at a
    purchase price of 110.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and
    unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date of such repurchase. If
    the net proceeds from this Offering are not sufficient to repurchase all of
    our outstanding Subordinated Notes at such price, we will purchase a lesser
    aggregate principal amount of Subordinated Notes with the available net
    proceeds. The Subordinated Notes accrue interest at a rate equal to 10.25%
    per annum and will mature on February 15, 2023.

(b) We intend to use approximately $108.4 million of the net proceeds from this
    Offering to redeem $97.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior
    Notes at a redemption price of 110.25% of the principal amount thereof, plus
    accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but excluding the date of such
    redemption. Net proceeds from this Offering will be applied first, to
    repurchase up to all of our Subordinated Notes, and second, to redeem up to
    $97.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, as
    described above. If the net proceeds from this Offering are not sufficient
    to redeem $97.5 million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes at
    such price after repurchasing all of our outstanding Subordinated Notes, as
    described above, we will redeem a lesser aggregate principal amount of
    Senior Notes with the available net proceeds. The Senior Notes accrue
    interest at a rate equal to 10.25% per annum and will mature on February 15,
    2023.

(c) To the extent any net proceeds from this Offering remain after repurchasing
    all of our Subordinated Notes and redeeming $97.5 million in aggregate
    principal amount of our Senior Notes, we intend to use such remaining net
    proceeds for working capital or general corporate purposes, including the
    repayment of amounts outstanding under our February 2015 Credit Agreement or
    our Receivables Securitization Facility. Borrowings under the February 2015
    Credit Agreement bear interest at a rate equal to either (a) a LIBOR rate
    determined by reference to the costs of funds for Eurodollar deposits for
    the interest period relevant to such borrowing, adjusted for certain
    additional costs, subject to a 1.00% floor in the case of term loans, plus a
    margin of 3.50%, or (b) a base rate plus 1.00%, in each case, plus a margin
    of 2.50%. Borrowings under the Receivables Securitization Facility bear
    interest based on a Eurodollar borrowing rate plus a utilized program fee of
    1.40%. 

To the extent that the aggregate net cash proceeds of this Offering are not
sufficient to repurchase all of our Subordinated Notes and to redeem $97.5
million in aggregate principal amount of our Senior Notes, we may elect to apply
a portion of our cash on hand towards the repurchase of our Subordinated Notes.
To the extent we do not apply cash on hand sufficient, together with net cash
proceeds from this Offering, to enable us to repurchase all of our Subordinated
Notes, and redeem $97.5 million of our Senior Notes, we intend to redeem a
lesser aggregate principal amount of Senior Notes with the available net
proceeds.

Under the terms of the indenture governing the Senior Notes, on or prior to
February 15, 2018, we may, subject to certain restrictions, redeem up to 40% of
the original aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes, with the net cash
proceeds of one or more equity offerings at a price equal to 110.25% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, up to but
excluding the date of redemption, provided that at least 50% of the original
aggregate principal amount of the Senior Notes remain outstanding after such
redemption. As of the date of this prospectus, up to $97.5 million in aggregate
principal amount of the $250.0 million in original aggregate principal amount of
our outstanding Senior Notes (of which $222.5 million is currently outstanding)
can be redeemed pursuant to the optional redemption provision described in the
preceding sentence. 

On February 15, 2017, we entered into a Notes Purchase Agreement with Deutsche
Bank AG (the “Notes Purchase Agreement”), who is the holder of 100% of our
outstanding Subordinated Notes, pursuant to which we agreed to use the net
proceeds of this Offering to repurchase, and Deutsche Bank AG agreed to sell to
us, all of the outstanding Subordinated Notes (or, to the extent the net
proceeds are not sufficient to repurchase all Subordinated Notes, a lesser
amount) at the Subordinated Notes Repurchase Price. Following the repurchase by
us of the Subordinated Notes, we anticipate that any such Subordinated Notes
would be cancelled.

An alternative investment vehicle formed by the limited partners of the Apollo
Funds owns substantially all of the economic interests in the Subordinated Notes
pursuant to certain derivative arrangements entered into with Deutsche Bank AG.
As such, we presently anticipate that any portion of the proceeds of this
Offering used by the Company to repurchase the Subordinated Notes would be paid,
directly or indirectly, to such alternative investment vehicle (net of any
amounts owed by such alternative investment vehicle to Deutsche Bank AG pursuant
to such derivative arrangements).

An independent special committee of our Board of Directors, advised by its own
counsel and financial advisor, recommended to our Board of Directors for their
approval that the net proceeds of this Offering be used to repurchase our
Subordinated Notes. The Board of Directors subsequently approved the proposed
use of proceeds of this Offering, including the repurchase of the Subordinated
Notes and the redemption of the Senior Notes.

The expected use of proceeds from this Offering represents our intentions based
upon our current plans and business conditions. The amounts and timing of our
actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors and any
unforeseen cash needs. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this Offering, subject to the terms and
conditions of the Notes Purchase Agreement."

  (2) Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor loaned and advanced us   
      $275,000 that were used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.     
      These loans and advances will be repaid upon completion of this offering out
      of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment
      of offering expenses other than underwriting commissions. In the event that 
      offering expenses are less than set forth in this table, any such amounts   
      will be used for post-closing working capital expenses.                     

  (3) The underwriter has agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.0%  
      of the gross proceeds of this offering. If the underwriter’s over-allotment 
      option is exercised, 5.0% of the gross proceeds from the over-allotment     
      ($0.50 per unit or up to $2,250,000 in the aggregate) will be deposited in  
      the trust account as deferred underwriting commissions. Upon completion of
      our initial business combination, $9,000,000, which constitutes the 
      underwriter’s deferred commissions (or up to $11,250,000 if the 
      underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to
      the underwriter from the funds held in the trust account and the remaining
      funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of 
      the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial 
      business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, including 
      payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in connection 
      with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of other 
      companies or for working capital. The underwriter will not be entitled to
      any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and 
      commissions.                                                   

  (4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
      of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
      we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
      estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
      combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
      In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
      subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
      with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
      addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
      number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
      do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
      fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
      fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
      category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
      the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
      account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect approximately     
      $1,050,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the funds held in  
      the trust account over 24 months following the closing of this offering;    
      however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate  
      assumes an interest rate of .35% per annum based upon current yields of     
      securities in which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order
      to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business
      combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our     
      officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may  
      be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
      such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
      Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the    
      trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not  
      close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust   
      account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account 
      would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans  
      may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at 
      a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
      be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor        
      including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Other   
      than as set forth above, the terms of such loans by our sponsor, an         
      affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors, if any,  
      have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to    
      such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our      
      sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and         
      directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to    
      loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek     
      access to funds in our trust account.                                       

  (5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
      initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment   
      fees for financing.                                                         

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement be deposited in a trust account.
Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $300,000,000 (or $345,000,000 if the undewriter’s over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $9,000,000 (or up to $11,250,000 if the
underwriter’s over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with CST acting as
trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. Based on current interest rates, we
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$1,050,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of .35% per year. We will not be
permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account, except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any. The proceeds from
this offering and the private placement of warrants will not be released from
the trust account until the earliest of: (i) the completion of our initial
business combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered
in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and 
(iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete 
our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering, subject to applicable law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor loaned and advanced us
$275,000 that were used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These
loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30,
2017 or the closing of this offering. These loans and advances will be repaid
upon the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that
has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held
outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity
at a price of $0.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor including
as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise period. Other than as set
forth above, the terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor
or certain of our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and
no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek
loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or
certain of our officers and directors, if any, as we do not believe third
parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and
all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may purchase public shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. However, they have no current commitments,
plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not formulated any
terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in such
transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in possession
of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such
purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not
currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender 
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a 
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such 
rules. There is no limit on the number of shares our sponsor, director, 
officers, advisors or their affiliates could purchase, except that all such 
purchases would be in compliance with applicable law as described above. Such 
parties would only need to purchase 11,250,001 of the 30,000,000 public shares,
or 37.5%, sold in this offering, in order to have our initial business 
combination approved (assuming the over-allotment option is not exercised and 
the initial stockholders do not purchase units in this offering or the 
aftermarket). Any such purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and 
Section 16 of the Exchange Act to the extent such purchasers are subject to such
reporting requirements. 

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (after payment of the underwriter’s
deferred commissions) at the consummation of our initial business combination
(so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement
for our business combination may require as a closing condition that we have a
minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders
exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible
asset requirement or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed
with the redemption of our public shares or the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly tendered in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders, directors and officers have entered into a letter
agreement with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive redemption rights
with respect to founder shares and public shares in connection with the
completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our initial
stockholders, directors and officers have agreed to waive rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to founder shares if we fail
to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
However, if any of our initial stockholders, officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

common stock in this offering. We will bear all costs, fees and expenses in

Concurrent Private Placement of approximately $46.6 million, or $47.1 million if
the underwriter exercises in full its option to purchase additional ordinary
shares after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses.

We currently intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering and
the Concurrent Private Placement for general corporate purposes, including:

    •   between $20,000,000 and $23,000,000 to conduct a Phase 2/3 clinical trial 
        of Plinabulin in combination with docetaxel for the reduction of docetaxel
        chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia and a Phase 2/3 clinical trial of 
        Plinabulin in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents for the      
        prevention of non-docetaxel chemotherapy-induced severe neutropenia;      

    •   between $5,000,000 and $7,000,000 to pay certain expenses in connection   
        with a Phase 2 trial of Plinabulin in combination with nivolumab for the  
        treatment of NSCLC;                                                       

    •   between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 to fund our collaboration with the Fred 
        Hutchinson Center and The University of Washington;                       

    •   between $1,000,000 and $1,500,000 to conduct preclinical studies and early
        clinical studies of BPI-002, BPI-003 and BPI-004 which we expect to be    
        sufficient through the submission of INDs;                                

    •   between $500,000 and $750,000 to support investigational and clinical     
        development of Plinabulin in NSCLC patients with KRAS mutations, which we 
        expect will allow us to cover the investigational and clinical development
        cost with respect to a Phase 2 trial of Plinabulin in NSCLC patients with 
        KRAS mutations;                                                           

    •   between $500,000 and $750,000 to support investigational clinical research
        related to brain tumors;                                                  

    •   between $1,000,000 and $2,000,000 to pay the NDA cost for the NSCLC       
        indication; and                                                           

    •   between $14,000,000 and $16,500,000 to pay salaries and consulting fees   
        and to cover general and administrative costs.                            

Pending such use of the net proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent
Private Placement, we intend to hold some amounts as cash and to invest the
remaining net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments,
including short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments denominated
in currencies and with maturities that match our contracted expenditures and
financial plans.

Our expected use of net proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business condition. The amounts and timing of our actual use of net proceeds
will vary depending on numerous factors, including our ability to obtain
additional financing, the relative success and cost of clinical and regulatory
development programs and the amount and timing of product revenue, if any. In
addition, we might decide to postpone or not pursue certain activities if, among
other factors, the net proceeds from this offering and the Concurrent Private
Placement and our other sources of cash are less than expected. In that case, we
would expect to focus on the development of Plinabulin for neutropenia and
cancer indications. Our management will have broad discretion in the application
of the net proceeds, and investors will be relying on our judgment regarding the
application of the net proceeds."
SNAP INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/snap-inc-899497-82723,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/snap-inc-899497-82723,424B4,3/3/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=11905497,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of $2.4 billion
(or approximately $2.6 billion if the underwriters’ option to purchase
additional shares of our Class A common stock from us is exercised in full)
based on the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share of Class A common
stock, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any of the proceeds from
the sale of Class A common stock in this offering by the selling stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility and create a public market for our Class A common stock.
We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from this offering for general
corporate purposes, including working capital, operating expenses, and capital
expenditures. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary
businesses, products, services, or technologies. However, we do not have
agreements or commitments for any material acquisitions at this time.

We intend to use some of the net proceeds to satisfy tax withholding obligations
related to the vesting and settlement of RSUs, which will begin to vest after
the completion of this offering. We do not currently know the amount of net
proceeds that would be used to satisfy these tax withholding obligations because
it depends on many factors, including our share price on the date of settlement
and the number of shares underlying RSUs that are settled on such date. Based on
the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share of Class A common stock,
24,623,776 shares underlying RSUs vesting on such date, and the applicable
income tax rate for certain of our employees from whom we will withhold taxes,
we will use approximately $195.2 million to satisfy these tax withholding
obligations.

We will have broad discretion over how to use the net proceeds from this
offering. We intend to invest the net proceeds to us from the offering that are
not used as described above in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing
instruments."

We will use approximately $37.2 million of the net proceeds from this offering
to purchase membership units in HLA from certain of its existing owners, at a
per-unit price equal to the per-share price paid by the underwriters for shares
of our Class A common stock in this offering. Accordingly, we will not retain
any of these proceeds.

We will use approximately $139.5 million of the net proceeds from this offering

purchase additional shares of Class A common stock in full) to purchase newly
issued membership units in HLA at a per-unit price equal to the per-share price

proceeds to repay principal and interest under the Term Loan (or approximately
$160.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional
shares of Class A common stock in full) and approximately $6.0 million to pay

estimate the amounts to be used for each of the purposes discussed above. The
amounts and timing of any expenditures will vary depending on the amount of cash
generated by our operations, competitive and technological developments and the
rate of growth, if any, of our business. Accordingly, our management will have
significant discretion and flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this
offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our management
regarding the application of these net proceeds.

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this
offering in short­term, interest­bearing obligations, investment­grade
instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government. The goal with respect to the investment of these net proceeds
will be capital preservation and liquidity so that these funds are readily
available to fund our operations."

(or $242.0 million if the underwriters exercise their option in full to purchase
additional shares of Class A common stock), after deducting underwriting
discounts and commissions but before deducting estimated offering expenses
payable by us.

We intend to contribute such net proceeds to our wholly owned subsidiary,
Carvana Sub, that will in turn use such net proceeds as follows:

• $210.7 million to acquire 18,750,000 newly-issued LLC Units (or $242.0 million
  to acquire 21,562,500 LLC Units if the underwriters exercise their option in 
  full to purchase additional shares of Class A common stock) in Carvana Group 
  at a purchase price per LLC Unit based on the initial public offering price of
  $15.00 per share, less underwriting discounts and commissions. In turn, 
  Carvana Group intends to:                            

• repay all outstanding borrowings under the Verde Credit Facility, under which
  $35.0 million was outstanding as of April 27, 2017, and which has a current 
  interest rate of 12.0% per annum and matures in August 2018 (borrowings under
  the Verde Credit Facility were used to fund working capital on a short term 
  basis);                                            

• transfer approximately 170,000 LLC Units to Ernest Garcia, II in exchange for
  his 0.1% ownership interest in Carvana, LLC;                           

• pay an estimated $5.5 million of expenses incurred in connection with the  
  Organizational Transactions; and                                           

• use the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes. We expect these 
  general corporate purposes to include funding working capital, operating   
  expenses and the selective pursuit of business development opportunities, 
  including to expand our current business through acquisitions of, or 
  investments in, other businesses, products or technologies. At this time,  
  other than the repayment of the Verde Credit Facility, we have not 
  specifically identified a material single use for which we intend to use the
  net proceeds, and, accordingly, we are not able to allocate the net proceeds
  among any of these potential uses in light of the variety of factors that will
  impact how such net proceeds are ultimately utilized by us.                   

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to fund
our operations and growth, to create a public market for our Class A common
stock and to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets. Pending
use of the net proceeds from this offering described above, we may invest the
net proceeds in short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the United States government."

this offering will be approximately $159.2 million after deducting underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive any
of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling
stockholders.

The principal purposes of this offering are to reduce our financial leverage,
increase our capitalization and financial flexibility, create a public market
for our common stock and enable access to the public equity markets for us and
our stockholders. We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to
repay approximately $159.2 million of borrowings outstanding under the Term Loan

common stock in this offering will be approximately $148.9 million, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated expenses payable

purchase up to an additional 1,425,000 shares of common stock from the selling
stockholders. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of common
stock by the selling stockholders.

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to repay indebtedness under
our Senior Secured Credit Facilities and use the remainder for general corporate
purposes. As of December 31, 2016, we had $90.8 million outstanding under the
Term Loan of our Senior Secured Credit Facilities. Our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities bear interest at a rate per annum equal to an applicable margin plus
a base rate determined by reference to the highest of either: (a) in the case of
loans denominated in U.S. dollars, (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.5%,
(ii) one-month LIBOR plus 1.00% and (iii) the prime commercial lending rate of
the administrative agent as in effect on the relevant day or (b) in the case of
loans denominated in Canadian dollars, (i) the prime commercial lending rate of
the administrative agent as in effect on the relevant day for determining
interest rates on Canadian dollar denominated commercial loans made in Canada
and (ii) CDOR plus 1.0%. Our Senior Secured Credit Facilities mature on
August 7, 2019.

After the repayment of indebtedness under our Senior Secured Credit Facilities,
we currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds from this offering for
general corporate purposes, which may include the payment of costs and expenses
associated with the implementation of our business strategy, although we have no
current specific plans for the use of the remaining net proceeds at this time.
The principal reasons for this offering are to repay indebtedness under our
Senior Secured Credit Facilities, increase our capitalization and financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and facilitate our
access to the capital markets in the future.

A repayment of the outstanding borrowings under our Senior Secured Credit
Facilities could result in at least 5% of the net proceeds of this offering
being paid to an affiliate of an underwriter who is a lender under our Senior
Secured Credit Facilities. Accordingly, this offering is being made in
compliance with the requirements of Rule 5121 of the FINRA rules.

The foregoing represents our current intentions with respect to the use and
allocation of the net proceeds of this offering based upon our present plans and
business conditions, but our management will have significant flexibility and
discretion in applying the net proceeds. The occurrence of unforeseen events or
changed business conditions could results in application of the net proceeds of
this offering in a manner other than as described in the prospectus."

$50.3 million, based upon the initial public offering price of $13.00 per common
share, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares from us in full, we estimate that the net proceeds
will be approximately $58.5 million after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We are undertaking this offering in order to increase our liquidity and raise
capital to further develop and advance our pipeline of product candidates. We
intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately $20.0 million to $30.0 million to fund clinical development  
  expenses for ZW25 through our ongoing adaptive Phase 1 clinical trial      
  (approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million), including monotherapy and  
  combination therapy cohort expansion arms and additional product candidate 
  manufacturing (approximately $10.0 million to $15.0 million);              

• approximately $5.0 million to fund clinical development expenses for ZW33  
  through our planned Phase 1 clinical trial and additional product candidate
  manufacturing;                                                             

• approximately $7.8 million to repay outstanding principal and interest under
  the Perceptive Facility which matures on June 2, 2020 and which we have used
  for working capital and general corporate purposes; advances under the
  Perceptive Facility bear interest at LIBOR + 10% annually, with LIBOR to be a
  minimum of 1%; we intend to repay the Perceptive Facility immediately after
  June 2, 2017; repayment at this time is subject to a penalty payment of 4% of
  the outstanding principal amount;                 

• approximately $10.0 million to $12.0 million to fund the development of    
  additional product candidates in our pipeline, including our bispecific ADC,
  T-Cell engaging bispecific and checkpoint modulating bispecific programs; and
                                                  
• the remainder for working capital and general corporate purposes, which may
  include other research and development programs, such as our proprietary   
  therapeutic platforms.

We may also use a portion of the net proceeds in connection with any exercise of
co-development or co-promotion rights under our current or future strategic
partnerships; however, no such rights exist or are currently exercisable. In
addition, we may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire, license and
invest in complementary products, technologies or businesses; however, we
currently have no agreements or commitments to complete any such transaction.

We currently conduct our research development, or R&D, using a hybrid model
approach where both computational and wet-lab methods are employed. All of the
computational R&D is performed internally whereas a majority of the wet-lab R&D
is subcontracted to third party contract research and manufacturing
organizations. For research, a significant portion of the subcontracted work is
performed by Canadian companies and institutions (e.g. National Research Council
of Canada and universities); however, certain activities may transition
internally into our laboratory facility which became operational in the first
quarter of 2017. In contrast, the majority of the subcontracted development and
manufacturing work is performed by international companies.

We have established cGMP manufacturing processes for the manufacturing of our
product candidates, ZW25 and ZW33. We have manufactured sufficient quantities of
ZW25 and ZW33 to satisfy our near-term clinical trial requirements. Pending
potential future clinical and commercial needs, we will be required to produce
additional quantities of ZW25 and ZW33. Additionally, there may be opportunities
to further optimize the manufacturing processes for ZW25 and ZW33 to minimize
the cost of goods prior to commercial production of these compounds.

We have funded our operations with proceeds from equity financings and
collaboration payments, and expect to seek additional financing through equity
financings and strategic collaborations to finance our product development and
corporate growth. Although it is difficult to predict future liquidity
requirements, based upon our current operating plan, we believe that the net
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash and cash
equivalents will enable us to continue to advance the clinical development of
our ZW25 and ZW33 product candidates. We may also be eligible to receive certain
research, development and commercial milestone payments in the future. However,
because successful development of our product candidates and the achievement of
milestones by our strategic partners is uncertain, we are unable to estimate the
actual funds we will require to complete the research, development and
commercialization of our product candidates.

This expected use of the net proceeds of this offering represents our intentions
based on our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds to be received upon the closing of this offering or the amounts
that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts, allocation
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including:

• the focus, scope and results of our research, drug discovery, preclinical and
  clinical development activities;                                       

• the type, number, costs and results of clinical trials for our product 
  candidates;                                                                

• regulatory actions relating to our product candidates;

• our ability to achieve milestones and obtain royalty payments from our
  strategic partners;                                                        

• whether any co-funding or co-promotion rights under our strategic partnerships
  are exercised;                                                

• competitive and technological developments; and

• the rate of growth, if any, of our business.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of capital preservation investments, including
short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities, certificates of
deposit or government securities."

approximately $70.9 million (or approximately $81.7 million if the underwriters
exercise in full their option to purchase an additional 865,200 ADSs), based on
initial public offering price of $13.50 per ADS in the U.S. offering and an
offering price of £1.32 per ordinary share in the European private placement,
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us. In addition, we expect to receive net proceeds
of approximately $398,700 from the sale by us of ordinary shares in the
shareholder private placement, after deducting placement agent fees.

We intend to use the net proceeds from the global offering and the shareholder
private placement, together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as
follows:

. approximately $49.0 million to advance clinical development of RPL554 for the
  maintenance treatment of COPD;

. approximately $13.0 million to advance clinical development of RPL554 for the
  treatment of acute exacerbations of COPD;

. approximately $14.0 million to advance clinical development of RPL554 for the
  treatment of CF; and

. the remainder to fund our other current and future research and development 
  activities and for working capital and other general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from the global offering and the
shareholder private placement represents our intentions based upon our current
plans and business conditions. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to
in-license, acquire or invest in additional businesses, technologies, products
or assets, although currently we have no specific agreements, commitments or
understandings in this regard. As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot
predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be
received upon the closing of the global offering and the shareholder private
placement or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth
above. Predicting the costs necessary to develop RPL554 and other product
candidates can be difficult. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures
and the extent of clinical development may vary significantly depending on
numerous factors, including the progress of our development efforts, the status
of and results from pre-clinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials or
clinical trials we may commence in the future, as well as any collaborations
that we may enter into with third parties for RPL554 or other product candidates
and any unforeseen cash needs. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from the global offering and
the shareholder private placement.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of the global offering, the
shareholder private placement and our current cash and cash equivalents, we
estimate that such funds will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating
expenses and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next 12 months.
We anticipate these funds will be sufficient for the completion of (i) our two
planned Phase 2b clinical trials, our planned PK clinical trial and our ongoing
Phase 2a clinical trial of RPL554 for the maintenance treatment of COPD,
(ii) our planned Phase 2 clinical trial of RPL554 for the treatment of acute
exacerbations of COPD and (iii) our ongoing Phase 2a clinical trial and our
planned Phase 2b proof-of-concept trial of RPL554 for the treatment of CF. We
have based this estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could use our available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from the global offering
and the shareholder private placement in short- and intermediate-term
interest-bearing obligations and certificates of deposit."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to support our organic
growth and for general corporate purposes, which may include, but is not limited

potential future acquisition opportunities that we believe may be complementary
to our business and provide attractive risk-adjusted returns."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses will be paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of up to $200,000 as described in this prospectus. These
    loans will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000
    of offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering 
    expenses (other than underwriting discounts and commissions) and amounts not
    to be held in the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are 
    less than set forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for 
    post-closing working capital expenses. In the event that the offering 
    expenses are more than as set forth in this table, we may fund such excess 
    with funds not held in the trust account.
            
(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting discounts and commissions
    equal to 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our
    initial business combination, $16,800,000, which constitutes the 
    underwriters’ deferred underwriting discounts and commissions (or 
    $19,320,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
    will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account, 
    and the remaining funds, less amounts released to the trustee to pay 
    redeeming stockholders, will be released to us and can be used to pay all or
    a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes, 
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in 
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of 
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be 
    entitled to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and
    commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify a business combination target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amount in the table above does not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only
    in U.S. government treasury obligations with a maturity of 180 days or less
    or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under 
    the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government 
    treasury obligations. We estimate the interest earned on the trust account
    will be approximately $96,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.02% 
    per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement
warrants, $480,000,000 (or $552,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full), including $16,800,000 (or $19,320,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting discounts and commissions, will be deposited into a U.S. based
trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer &
Trust Company acting as trustee, and approximately $11,600,000, or approximately
$13,040,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full,
will be used to pay expenses in connection with the closing of this offering and
for working capital following this offering. The proceeds held in the trust
account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury obligations with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $96,000 per year, assuming an interest
rate of 0.02% per year; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this
amount. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations, the proceeds from this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest to occur of (a) the completion of our initial business combination
(including the release of funds to pay any amounts due to any public
stockholders who properly exercise their redemption rights in connection
therewith), (b) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing
of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete an
initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering
or (c) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject
to applicable law. Based on current interest rates, we do not expect that the
interest earned on the trust account, net of income taxes, will be sufficient to
pay Delaware franchise taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.
There is no limitation on our ability to raise funds privately or through loans
in connection with our initial business combination, including pursuant to
forward purchase agreements we may enter into following consummation of this
offering.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or any
of their affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance
funds to, or invest in, us.

We will reimburse our sponsor for office space, utilities, secretarial support
and administrative services provided to members of our management team, in an
amount equal to $10,000 per month. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has agreed to loan us up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. These loans
are non-interest bearing, unsecured and are due at the earlier of June 30, 2017
or the closing of this offering. The loan will be repaid upon the closing of
this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering proceeds not held in the trust
account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants, including as to exercise
price, exercisability and exercise period. Except as set forth above, the terms
of such loans, if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist
with respect to such loans. Prior to the completion of our initial business
combination, we do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor
or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be
willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to
seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have entered into a forward purchase agreement with our sponsor pursuant to
which it has agreed to purchase an aggregate of up to 40,000,000 shares of our
Class A common stock, plus an aggregate of up to 13,333,333 warrants, for a
purchase price of $10.00 per forward purchase unit, or an aggregate purchase
price of up to $400,000,000 in a private placement that will close
simultaneously with the closing of our initial business combination. Our sponsor
will purchase a number of forward purchase units that will result in gross
proceeds to us necessary to enable us to consummate our initial business
combination and pay related fees and expenses, after first applying amounts
available to us from the trust account (after paying the deferred underwriting
discounts and commissions and giving effect to any redemptions of public shares)
and any other financing source obtained by us for such purpose at or prior to
the consummation of our initial business combination, plus any additional
amounts mutually agreed by us and our sponsor to be retained by the
post-business combination company for working capital or other purposes. These
purchases will be required to be made regardless of whether any shares of Class
A common stock are redeemed by our public stockholders in connection with our
initial business combination and are intended to provide us with a minimum
funding level for our initial business combination.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior
to or following the completion of our initial business combination. However,
they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules 
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our business combination may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares
or the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the redemption of any public shares
properly submitted in connection with our completion of an initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the substance or timing
of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated
an initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering or (iii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law and as further described herein and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our sponsor, officers and directors have entered into a letter agreement with
us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any founder shares and any public shares held by them in connection
with the completion of our initial business combination. In addition, our
initial stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to any founder shares held by
them if we fail to complete our business combination within the prescribed time
frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates
acquires public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to
liquidating distributions from the trust account with respect to such public
shares if we fail to complete our initial business combination within the
prescribed time frame."

additional shares of our Class A common stock from us is exercised in full, we
estimate that our net proceeds would be approximately $194.8 million, after
deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock and facilitate
our future access to the public equity markets. We currently intend to use the
net proceeds that we will receive from this offering for working capital, other
general corporate purposes and to fund our growth strategies, including
continued investments in our business, expanding our international footprint and
growing demand for our external use case. We may also use a portion of the net
proceeds that we receive to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,
products, services, technologies or other assets. We have not entered into any
agreements or commitments with respect to any acquisitions or investments at
this time.

We cannot specify with certainty the particular uses of the net proceeds that we
will receive from this offering or the amounts we actually spend on the uses set
forth above. Pending the use of proceeds from this offering as described above,
we plan to invest the net proceeds that we receive in this offering in
short-term and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade
investments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the
U.S. government. Our management will have broad discretion in the application of
the net proceeds from this offering and investors will be relying on the
judgment of our management regarding the application of the proceeds."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    borrowed from our sponsor described below. These funds will be repaid out of
    the proceeds of this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    founders’ units.

(3) The amount of proceeds not held in trust will remain constant at 
    approximately $550,000 even if the over-allotment is exercised.

(4) These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these
    items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may 
    incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in 
    connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business combination
    based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not
    anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than 
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.

Our sponsor has committed to purchase the founders’ units (for an aggregate
purchase price of $5,550,000) from us on a private placement basis
simultaneously with the consummation of this offering. Our sponsor has also
agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the underwriters in
full or in part, it will purchase from us an additional number of founders’
units (up to a maximum of 67,500 founders’ units) at a price of $10.00 per
founders’ unit necessary to maintain in the trust account $10.10 per unit sold
to the public in this offering. These additional founders’ units will be
purchased in a private placement that will occur simultaneously with the
purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the over-allotment option. The
founders’ units are identical to the units sold in this offering, subject to
certain limited exceptions as described elsewhere in this prospectus. All of the
proceeds we receive from these purchases will be placed in the trust account
described below.

$151,500,000, or $174,225,000 if the over-allotment option is exercised in full,
of net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the founders’ units will be
placed in a U.S.- based trust account at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee.
The funds held in trust will be invested only in United States “government
securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act
having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting the
conditions of paragraph (d) under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment
Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations, so
that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company
Act. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust
account that may be released to us to pay our franchise and income tax
obligations and up to $100,000 for dissolution expenses, the proceeds will not
be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a
business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. Any
amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target business may be
used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to an affiliate of our sponsor of a monthly fee of an aggregate of
$10,000 is for general and administrative services including office space,
utilities and secretarial support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our
sponsor for our benefit and is not intended to provide our sponsor or affiliated
officers and directors with compensation in lieu of a salary. This arrangement
will terminate upon completion of our initial business combination or the
distribution of the trust account to our public stockholders. Other than the
$10,000 per month fee and the repayment of loans from our sponsor (none of which
payments will be made from the proceeds of this offering held in the trust
account prior to the completion of our initial business combination), no
compensation of any kind will be paid to our sponsor, officers, directors or any
of their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such entity and individuals
will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in
connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target
businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and
business combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or
similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations.
Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made
to our sponsor, officers, directors or our or their respective affiliates, with
any interested director abstaining from such review and approval. There is no
limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us; provided, however, that
to the extent such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the
trust account, such expenses would not be reimbursed by us unless we consummate
an initial business combination. Since the role of present management after a
business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what
remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business
combination.

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for a business combination will be approximately
$550,000. We intend to use the proceeds for miscellaneous expenses such as
paying fees to consultants to assist us with our search for a target business
and for director and officer liability insurance premiums, with the balance
being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, accounting and other
expenses of structuring and negotiating business combinations exceed our
estimates, as well as for reimbursement of any out-of-pocket expenses incurred
by our sponsor, officers and directors in connection with activities on our
behalf as described below.

The allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business combination is
less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise
additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We may use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering, including the
funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and to pay our
expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole
or in part as consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held
in the trust account which are not used to consummate a business combination
(including to pay converting stockholders as described herein) will be disbursed
to the combined company and will, along with any other net proceeds not
expended, be used as working capital to finance the operations of the target
business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways
including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic
acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new
products.

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account
and any available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that we
are permitted to withdraw.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced us an aggregate of
$165,598 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering
referenced in the line items above for SEC registration fee, FINRA filing fee,
the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a portion of the legal
and audit fees and expenses. The advances will be payable without interest on
the consummation of this offering. The advances will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses.

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds (which includes amounts that may be released to us from the
trust account) to operate for the next 24 months, assuming that a business
combination is not consummated during that time. However, if necessary, in order
to meet our working capital needs following the consummation of this offering,
our sponsor, officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds, from time to time or at any time, in whatever amount they deem reasonable
in their sole discretion. Each loan would be evidenced by a promissory note. The
notes would either be paid upon consummation of our initial business
combination, without interest, or, at holder’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of
the notes may be converted into units at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for
example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000 shares of Class A
common stock if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted since the 150,000 rights
included in such units would result in the issuance of 15,000 shares upon the
closing of our business combination, as well as 75,000 warrants to purchase
75,000 shares). The units would be identical to the founders’ units. If we do
not complete a business combination, the loans will be forgiven.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (i) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (ii) if that public
stockholder converts such shares, or sells such shares to us in a tender offer,
in connection with a business combination which we consummate or (iii) we seek
to amend any provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation
that would stop our public stockholders from converting or selling their shares
to us in connection with a business combination or affect the substance or
timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not
complete a business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering. This redemption right shall apply in the event of the approval of any
such amendment to our amended and restated certificate of incorporation, whether
proposed by our sponsor, any executive officer or director or any other person.
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account."

$281 million, or approximately $359 million if the underwriters exercise their
over-allotment option in full, at the initial public offering price of $19.00
per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We intend to use approximately $100 million of the net proceeds from this
offering to repay the senior note outstanding under our Note Purchase Agreement
dated May 7, 2010. The senior note bears interest at a rate of 4.83% and matures
on May 7, 2017. The proceeds from the senior note were used for general 
corporate purposes. In addition, we intend to use approximately $50 million of
the net proceeds from this offering to repay amounts outstanding under our
Accounts Receivable Facility. The Accounts Receivable Facility bears interest at
a floating rate based on a spread of 85 basis points plus the 30-day LIBOR
market index rate and matures on December 17, 2017. The proceeds from the
Accounts Receivable Facility were used for general corporate purposes. The
remaining net proceeds from this offering will be used for general corporate
purposes, including capital expenditures, such as chassis purchases as part of
our conversion from a rented chassis model to a company-owned chassis model
(current intention is in an amount of approximately $110 million) as described
on pages 6-7, 86 and 91 of this prospectus, and potential acquisitions.

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling
shareholders but we will be required to pay the underwriting discounts and
commissions associated with such sales of shares. The selling shareholders will
receive approximately $230 million of proceeds from this offering."

stock in this offering at an initial public offering price of $6.50 per share,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us, will be approximately $69 million, or
$81 million if the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is
exercised in full.

We will use approximately $14.9 million of the net proceeds to repay a portion
of the outstanding amount under our convertible term notes, approximately
$53.0 million of the net proceeds to pay down or pay off the ELCS Sub-debt Term
Note, the 4th Tranche Term Note and the UK Term Note outstanding under the VPC
Facility and the remainder, if any, for general corporate purposes, including to
fund a portion of the loans made to our customers. VPC has agreed to purchase
2.3 million shares in the offering at the initial public offering price, and we
intend to use the proceeds from that purchase, approximately $14.9 million, to
reduce an equivalent amount of indebtedness under the convertible term notes.
Pursuant to our financing agreement, the outstanding borrowings under the notes
under the VPC Facility were used to finance customer loan growth for our Rise
and Sunny products and for working capital. The convertible term notes will
mature on January 30, 2018 and generally bear interest at the greater of 10% or
a base rate (defined as the 3-month LIBOR rate, with a 1% floor) plus 9%. We
were required to draw-down the maximum borrowing amount of $25 million prior to
January 5, 2017, and we made an initial draw in October 2016 of $10 million and
a subsequent draw in January 2017 of $15 million, bringing the total amount
drawn-down on the convertible term notes to $25 million. The ELCS Sub-debt Term
Note will mature on January 30, 2018, and the $45 million outstanding under the
ELCS Sub-debt Term Note as of December 31, 2016 generally bears interest at the
3-month LIBOR rate plus 18%. The 4th Tranche Term Note will mature on
January 30, 2018, and the $25 million outstanding on the 4th Tranche Term Note
as of December 31, 2016 generally bears interest at the 3-month LIBOR plus 17%.
The UK Term Note will mature on January 30, 2018, and the $47.8 million
outstanding under the UK Term Note as of December 31, 2016 generally bears
interest at the 3-month LIBOR rate plus 16%.

We will have broad discretion over the uses of the net proceeds in this offering
that we do not use to repay indebtedness. Pending these uses, we intend to
invest the net proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment-grade,
interest-bearing securities such as money market accounts, certificates of
deposit, commercial paper and guaranteed obligations of the US government."

of common units offered by this prospectus based on an assumed initial public
offering price of $23.00 per common unit, after deducting underwriting
discounts, structuring fees and estimated offering expenses. Our estimate
assumes the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units from us is
not exercised. We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

•   approximately $302.2 million will be distributed to our Sponsors, in whole
    or in part as reimbursement of preformation capital expenditures;         

•   approximately $10.0 million will be retained for general partnership
    purposes, including to fund expansion capital expenditures and our working
    capital needs; and                                                        

•   $3.8 million will be used to pay revolving credit facility origination fees.

If and to the extent the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional common units, the number of common units purchased by the
underwriters pursuant to any exercise will be sold to the public, and any
remaining common units not purchased by the underwriters pursuant to any
exercise of the option will be issued to our Sponsors at the expiration of the
option period for no additional consideration. If the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional common units in full, the additional net
proceeds to us would be approximately $47.7 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and structuring fees. We will use any net proceeds from
the exercise of the underwriters’ option to purchase additional common units

flexibility, create a public market for our Class A common stock and facilitate
our future access to the capital markets. Although we have not yet determined
with certainty the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, we expect to use the net proceeds from this offering for working
capital and other general corporate purposes. We also intend to use
approximately $20.0 million of the net proceeds to pay all remaining outstanding
principal and interest under our term loan with Silicon Valley Bank and
approximately $7.4 million of the net proceeds to pay a cash dividend to the
holders of our Series A preferred stock that is payable upon the conversion of
our Series A preferred stock to Class B common stock, which will occur
immediately prior to the closing of this offering.

We may also use a portion of the proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or
strategic investments in complementary businesses or technologies, although we
do not currently have any plans for any such acquisitions or investments. We
have not allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes.

The expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our present plans and business conditions. We cannot predict with
certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. Accordingly,
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of
this offering. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on
many factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of
our business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this
offering in a variety of capital-preservation investments, including short- and
intermediate-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities and government
securities."

• to redeem approximately $283 million in aggregate principal amount of our
  10.25% Senior Notes due 2019;

• for general corporate purposes; and

We intend to use the net proceeds from the offering to repay $53.0 million
aggregate principal amount of our outstanding term loans under the Senior
Secured Credit Agreement. The indebtedness that we intend to repay bears
interest at a rate of 9.25% per annum and matures in August 2019. Affiliates of

approximately $89.5 million (or approximately $103.4 million if the underwriters
exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full), based on the initial
public offering price of $17.00 per ADS, after deducting underwriting discounts
and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial 
flexibility to advance our clinical pipeline, create a public market for our
securities in the United States and facilitate our future access to the U.S.
public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:
 
. approximately $35.5 million to advance clinical development of ARGX-113 for
  the treatment of autoimmune diseases, which we expect will be sufficient to
  complete our Phase 2 clinical trials in MG and ITP and start preparations for
  a potential pivotal trial in one selected indication;

. approximately $10.2 million to advance clinical development of ARGX-110 for
  the treatment of hematological malignancies, which we expect will be
  sufficient to complete our Phase 2 clinical trial in CTCL and our Phase 1/2
  clinical trial in newly diagnosed AML and high-risk MDS;

. approximately $3.5 million to expand applications of ARGX-113 to develop a
  subcutaneous formulation and explore additional indications, which we expect
  will be sufficient to complete a Phase 1 clinical trial in healthy volunteers
  for a subcutaneous formulation; and

. the remainder to fund other current and future research and development
  activities and technology development and for working capital and other
  general corporate purposes.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our 
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions. We may also use
a portion of the net proceeds to in-license, acquire, or invest in additional
businesses, technologies, products or assets. We cannot predict with certainty
all of the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the closing
of this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set
forth above. Predicting the costs necessary to develop antibody candidates can
be difficult. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures and the extent
of clinical development may vary significantly depending on numerous factors,
including the progress, timing and completion of our development efforts, the
status of and results from preclinical studies and any ongoing clinical trials
or clinical trials we may commence in the future, the time and costs involved in
obtaining regulatory approval for our product candidates as well as maintaining
our existing collaborations and any collaborations that we may enter into with
third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs. As a
result, our management will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the
net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our planned use of the net proceeds of this offering and our current
cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets, we estimate that such funds
will be sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital
expenditure requirements through at least the next 12 months. We have based this
estimate on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we could use our
available capital resources sooner than we currently expect.

Pending their use, we plan to invest the net proceeds from this offering in
short- and intermediate-term interest-bearing obligations and certificates of
deposit."
BRIGHT SCHOLAR EDUCATION HOLDINGS LTD,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/bright-scholar-education-holdings-ltd-1020981-83433,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/bright-scholar-education-holdings-ltd-1020981-83433,424B4,5/19/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12080005,"We estimate that we will receive net proceeds from this offering of 
approximately US$144.5 million, or approximately US$166.6 million if the 
underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional ADSs in full, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and the estimated offering
expenses payable by us.

The primary purposes of this offering are to create a public market for our ADSs
for the benefit of all shareholders, retain talented employees by providing them
with equity incentives and obtain additional capital. We plan to use the net
proceeds of this offering as follows:

• approximately 50.0% for launching new schools; however, we are currently able
  to remit approximately US$2.1 million into Zhuhai Bright Scholar, a 
  foreign-invested enterprise indirectly owned by us in China, for purposes of 
  launching new schools, and if we intend to apply more proceeds towards this
  purpose, we will need to obtain PRC government registration and approval,
  which may take up to several months and involve substantial uncertainty;
                                                           
• approximately 15.0% for marketing and brand promotion;

• approximately 15.0% for curriculum design and other research and development
  efforts; and                                                  

• approximately 20.0% for selective investments and acquisitions and general 
  corporate purposes.                                                       

The foregoing represents our current intentions based upon our present plans and
business conditions to use and allocate the net proceeds of this offering. Our
management, however, will have significant flexibility and discretion to apply
the net proceeds of this offering. If an unforeseen event occurs or business
conditions change, we may use the proceeds of this offering differently than as
described in this prospectus. You must rely on the judgment of our management as
to the use of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending any use described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term, interest-bearing, debt instruments or demand deposits.

We intend to apply the net proceeds of this offering towards launching new
schools by withdrawing the RMB funds converted from the U.S. dollars held in the
account of Zhuhai Bright Scholar for a number of purposes that fall within its
business scope or otherwise permitted under PRC laws and regulations. For
example, Zhuhai Bright Scholar may provide loans to individual schools for
substantial expenditures (such as those for construction and improvement of
school facilities, rent for school facilities and staff salaries) or as working
capital, or it may advance funds to them for purchasing school supplies.

Subject to the requirements and limitations outlined below, we are currently
able to fund our operations in China by (1) contributing the initially
subscribed registered capital of up to RMB10 million (approximately US$1.5
million) in Zhuhai Bright Scholar, and (2) providing shareholder loans of up to
RMB4 million (approximately US$0.6 million) to Zhuhai Bright Scholar. We also
plan for Zhuhai Bright Scholar to apply to the local MOFCOM office to increase
its total investment amount and registered capital so we can make further
capital contributions and provide more shareholder loans to Zhuhai Bright
Scholar to support the launching of new schools. We also plan to establish new
foreign-invested enterprises to facilitate our business expansion and make
additional investments in the manners described below.

In general, we may apply the net proceeds raised in this offering into China
through several approaches, primarily including (1) capital contribution to
Zhuhai Bright Scholar and/or new foreign-invested enterprises, and (2)
shareholder loans to Zhuhai Bright Scholar and/or new foreign-invested
enterprises. A foreign-invested enterprise must have a registered capital and a
total investment amount approved by local MOFCOM offices.  

• Under the first approach, we may transfer the net proceeds into Zhuhai Bright
  Scholar or other foreign-invested enterprise we establish to contribute the
  initially subscribed registered capital. If the registered capital is not 
  sufficient to cover the intended capital contribution, we may apply to the
  local MOFCOM office to increase its registered capital and total investment
  amount. The local MOFCOM office will consider the proposed use of capital and
  business plan before approving the increases. Establishing new 
  foreign-invested enterprises is also subject to the approval of local MOFCOM
  offices.                                         

• Under the second approach, we may provide shareholder loans to Zhuhai Bright
  Scholar or other foreign-invested enterprise we establish, which is subject to
  the registration with local SAFE offices. The aggregate loan amount may not
  exceed the difference between the total investment amount and the registered
  capital of such foreign-invested enterprise, and we may apply to the local
  MOFCOM office to increase the registered capital and the total investment
  amount in order to loan a sufficient amount of funds to the foreign-invested
  enterprise.                                       

We cannot guarantee that we will be able to obtain the government registrations
or approvals necessary to make capital contributions or provide loans on a 
timely basis, if at all. Any failure will delay or prevent us from applying the
net proceeds from this offering to our PRC subsidiaries and affiliated entities."

from the sale of the shares of common stock offered in this offering, or
approximately $110.4 million, if the underwriters exercise their option to
purchase additional shares in full, after deducting the estimated underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We intend to use the net proceeds from this
offering as follows:

• approximately $45 million to advance development of trilaciclib;

• approximately $20 million to advance development of G1T38;

• approximately $15 million for drug manufacturing and to advance development of
  G1T48; and                                                                    

• the balance for working capital and general corporate purposes.

The timing and costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval for a product
candidate are highly uncertain and are dependent upon many factors that are
beyond our control. Accordingly, we do not believe it is possible at this time
to accurately project to what stage of clinical development the proceeds of this
offering will allow us to advance our product candidates.

We believe opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current
business through acquisitions or in-licenses of complementary companies,
medicines or technologies. While we have no current agreements, commitments or
understandings for any specific acquisitions or in-licenses at this time, we may
use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Although we currently anticipate that we will use the net proceeds from this
offering as described above, there may be circumstances where a reallocation of
funds is necessary. Due to the uncertainties inherent in the product development
process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net
proceeds from this offering that may be used for the above purposes. The amounts
and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous factors,
including our sales and marketing and commercialization efforts, demand for our
drugs, our operating costs and other factors. Accordingly, our management will
have flexibility in applying the net proceeds from this offering. An investor
will not have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other
information on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds.

Pending their use as described above, we plan to invest the net proceeds in
short-term, interest-bearing obligations, investment-grade instruments,
certificates of deposit or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

    offering expenses are less than as set forth in this table, any such amounts 
    will be available for post-closing working capital requirements. As of       
    May 11, 2017, $350,000 was outstanding under these loans.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5% 
    of the gross proceeds of this offering (or approximately 3.76% of the gross  
    proceeds of this offering if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is      
    exercised in full). Upon completion of our initial business combination,     
    $6,300,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred commissions (or     
    $7,785,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)  
    will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account and
    the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a   
    portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our   
    initial business combination occurs or for general corporate purposes,       
    including payment of principal or interest on indebtedness incurred in       
    connection with our initial business combination, to fund the purchases of   
    other companies or for working capital. The underwriters will not be entitled
    to any interest accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and           
    commissions.                                                                 

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all 
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example,
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial 
    business combination based upon the level of complexity of such business 
    combination. In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific 
    industry subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses 
    associated with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal 
    counsel. In addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may 
    engage a number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due 
    diligence. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds,
    other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses,
    which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any 
    specific category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The
    amounts in the table above do not include interest available to us from the
    trust account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect 
    approximately $900,000 to be available to us from interest earned on the 
    funds held in the trust account over the 12 months following the closing of
    this offering; however, we can provide no assurances regarding this amount.
    In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial
    business combination, our sponsor has committed to loan us up to an 
    aggregate of $500,000, to be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to
    investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital 
    requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business 
    combination. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in 
    connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor, an 
    affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers or directors may, but 
    are not obligated to, loan us any additional funds as may be required. If we
    complete our initial business combination, we would repay such loaned 
    amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise,
    such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account.
    In the event that our initial business combination does not close, we may 
    use a portion of the funds held outside the trust account to repay such 
    loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay
    such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such loans may be convertible into
    working capital loan warrants of the post-business combination entity at a 
    price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The working capital
    loan warrants would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to
    our sponsor, including as to exercise price, exercisability and exercise 
    period except that, (i) such warrants shall not be exercisable more than 
    five years from the effective date of the registration statement of which 
    this prospectus forms a part and (ii) pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(g)(1), 
    such warrants, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such
    warrants, shall be subject to certain additional restrictions on transfer. 
    Other than as set forth below, the terms of such loans by our sponsor, an 
    affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers or directors, if any, 
    have not been determined and no written agreements exist with respect to 
    such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other than our 
    sponsor, an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers or 
    directors, if any, as we do not believe third parties will be willing to 
    loan such funds and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek 
    access to funds in our trust account.                                   

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our      
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment    
    fees for financing. This amount does not include any investment banking fees 
    which may be payable upon completion of our initial business combination.    
    Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc. has not yet been retained for a specific        
    financial advisory, underwriting, capital raising or other transaction and so
    we are not able to quantify the fees for any such engagement. No funds will
    be paid out of the trust to fund any such fee payments and it is not 
    expected that any fees would be paid prior to the completion of a business 
    combination. The actual amount of fees received will vary significantly 
    based on the size of any transaction and the extent to which other 
    investment banks are involved. This amount includes the up to $250,000 that
    we have agreed to reimburse the underwriters for their reasonable
    out-of-pocket expenses including but not limited to legal fees, due 
    diligence expenses of up to $17,500 and road show expenses.

(6) In order to finance transaction costs in connection with an intended initial 
    business combination, our sponsor has committed to loan us up to an aggregate
    of $500,000, to be provided to us to fund our expenses relating to           
    investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital      
    requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business           
    combination.                                                                 

(7) Our sponsor has agreed that if the over-allotment option is exercised by the 
    underwriters in full or in part, it will purchase from us an additional      
    number of private placement warrants (up to a maximum of 270,000) at a price 
    of $1.00 per warrant, in an amount necessary to maintain the trust account at
    $10.10 per unit sold to the public in this offering. These additional private
    placement warrants will be purchased in a private placement that will occur  
    simultaneously with the purchase of units resulting from the exercise of the 
    over-allotment option.                                                       

The rules of NASDAQ provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $181,800,000 (or $209,070,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including $6,300,000 (or $7,785,000
if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will be deposited in a segregated trust account
located in the United States with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company,
acting as trustee, and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills
with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain
conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in
direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Based on current interest rates, we
estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be approximately
$900,000 per year. Except with respect to interest earned on the funds held in
the trust account that may be released to us to pay our taxes, if any, we will
not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the trust
account and these funds will not be released from the trust account until the
earliest of: (i) the completion of our initial business combination; (ii) the
redemption of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial
business combination within 18 months from the closing date of this offering (or
21 months from the closing date of this offering if we have executed a letter of
intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing date of this offering but have not
completed the initial business combination within such 18 month period), subject
to applicable law, and (iii) the redemption of our public shares properly
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our
second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that would affect the
substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we
have not completed our initial business combination within 18 months from the
closing date of this offering (or 21 months, as applicable). Based on current
interest rates, we expect that interest earned on the trust account will be
sufficient to pay our taxes.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. However, if our estimate of
the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating a business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be
required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which
is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek additional capital, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
our sponsor, members of our management team or any of their affiliates, but, 
other than as set forth below, such persons are not under any obligation to loan
funds to, or invest in, us.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor may loan us up to an
aggregate of $650,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering.
These loans are non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the earlier of June
30, 2017 or the closing of this offering. These loans will be repaid upon the
closing of this offering out of the $650,000 of offering proceeds that has been
allocated to the payment of offering expenses. As of May 11, 2017, $350,000 was
outstanding under these loans.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, (i) our sponsor has committed to loan us
up to an aggregate of $500,000, to be provided to us in the event that funds
held outside of the trust are insufficient to fund our expenses relating to
investigating and selecting a target business and other working capital
requirements after this offering and prior to our initial business combination
and (ii) our sponsor, one or more affiliates of our sponsor, or certain of our
officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us any additional
funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account
released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held
outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business combination
does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the
trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust
account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of such
loans may be convertible into working capital loan warrants of the post business
combination entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender.
The working capital loan warrants would be identical to the private placement
warrants issued to our sponsor, including as to exercise price, exercisability
and exercise period except that, (i) such warrants shall not be exercisable more
than five years from the effective date of the registration statement of which
this prospectus forms a part and (ii) pursuant to FINRA Rule 5110(g)(1), such
warrants, and the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of such
warrants, shall be subject to certain additional restrictions on transfer. Other
than as set forth above, the terms of such loans by our sponsor, an affiliate of
our sponsor or certain of our officers or directors, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor, an affiliate of our 
sponsor or certain of our officers or directors, if any, as we do not believe 
third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against
any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.

We have granted Macquarie Capital (USA) Inc., an affiliate of our sponsor (and
an underwriter of this offering), a right of first refusal for a period of 36
months from the closing date of this offering to provide to us certain financial
advisory, underwriting, capital raising, and other services for which it may
receive fees.

Our sponsor, other initial stockholders, directors, executive officers, advisors
or any of their affiliates may purchase public shares or public warrants in
privately negotiated transactions or on the open market either prior to or
following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and
have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. None of
the funds held in the trust account will be used to purchase public shares or
public warrants in such transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they
will not make any such purchases when they are in possession of any material
non-public information not disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are
prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do not currently
anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender offer subject
to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a going-private transaction
subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange Act; however, if the
purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that the purchases are
subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such rules. Any such
purchases will be reported pursuant to Section 13 and Section 16 of the Exchange
Act to the extent such purchases are subject to such reporting requirements.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the
SEC’s “penny stock” rules) and the agreement for our initial business
combination may require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth
or a certain amount of cash. If too many public stockholders exercise their
redemption rights so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement
or any net worth or cash requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption
of our public shares or the business combination, and instead would search for
an alternate business combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earliest to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination; (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing date
of this offering (or 21 months from the closing date of this offering if we have
executed a letter of intent, agreement in principle or definitive agreement for
an initial business combination within 18 months from the closing date of this
offering but have not completed the initial business combination within such 18
month period), subject to applicable law; and (iii) the redemption of our public
shares properly submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to approve an
amendment to our second amended and restated certificate of incorporation that
would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem 100% of our
public shares if we have not completed our initial business combination within
18 months from the closing date of this offering (or 21 months, as applicable).
In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest
of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and any public shares they may acquire during or after this
offering in connection with the completion of our initial business combination.
Our other directors and officers have entered into letter agreements similar to
the one entered into by our initial stockholders with respect to any public
shares acquired by them in or after this offering. In addition, our initial
stockholders have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from
the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete
our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing date of this
offering (or 21 months, as applicable). However, if our initial stockholders or
any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquire any public shares in or
after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the
trust account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our
initial business combination within the allotted 18-month time frame (or
21-month time frame, as applicable)."

We intend to fund our $40.0 million to $55.0 million 2017 capital program with a
portion of the net proceeds from this offering, along with cash flows from
operations. We have not yet made final decisions with respect to our use of the
remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, though we may use such
proceeds to develop additional proppant logistics capabilities, identify and
develop new product and service offerings or pursue acquisitions. We cannot
currently allocate specific percentages of the net proceeds that we may use for
such purposes. Until we use our net proceeds of the offering, we intend to
invest the funds in United States government securities and other short-term,
investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments or high-grade corporate notes.

The revolving credit commitments under our Credit Facility (the “Revolving
Facility”) have a scheduled maturity date of December 1, 2018 and the advance
loan commitments under our Credit Facility (the “Advance Loan Facility”) have a
scheduled maturity date of December 1, 2021. As of December 31, 2016, the Credit
Facility had an outstanding balance of approximately $2.5 million and bore
interest at a weighted average interest rate of 5.3%. The borrowings to be
repaid, which currently consist of $1.0 million under the Revolving Facility and
$4.5 million under the Advance Loan Facility, were incurred primarily to fund
capital expenditures and the growth of our business. While we currently do not
have plans to immediately borrow additional amounts under our Credit Facility,
we may at any time reborrow amounts repaid under the Revolving Facility and we
may do so to fund our capital program and for other general corporate purposes.
In connection with this offering, we expect to amend our Credit Facility to,
among other things, terminate the Advance Loan Facility and extend the maturity
date of the Revolving Facility to on or around the fourth anniversary of the
consummation of this offering.

To the extent the underwriters’ option to purchase additional shares is
exercised, Solaris Inc. will contribute the net proceeds therefrom to Solaris
LLC in exchange for an additional number of Solaris LLC Units equal to the
number of shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to the underwriters’
option. Solaris LLC will use any such net proceeds to redeem from the Existing
Owners on a pro rata basis a number of Solaris LLC Units (together with an
equivalent number of shares of our Class B common stock) equal to the number of
shares of Class A common stock issued pursuant to the underwriters’ option to
purchase additional shares."
"ASV HOLDINGS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/asv-holdings-inc-1018915-83201,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/asv-holdings-inc-1018915-83201,424B4,5/15/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12066274,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock in
this offering will be approximately $10.7 million, based on the initial public
offering price of $7.00 per share, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We will not receive
any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling
stockholders in this offering, including any sales of shares of our common stock
pursuant to the underwriters’ over-allotment option, although we will bear the
costs, other than underwriting discounts and commissions, associated with those
sales.

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital to
support our operations, to establish a public market for our common stock, to
facilitate our future access to the public capital markets and to create
liquidity for the selling stockholders. Our credit agreement requires that we
use 40% of the net proceeds from this offering to pay down amounts outstanding
under the credit agreement.

As of December 31, 2016, there was $45.6 million outstanding under our credit
agreement, and, accordingly, we are required by our credit agreement to use $4.3
million of our net proceeds from this offering for repayment of the amounts
outstanding under our term loans, based on the initial public offering price of
$7.00. In addition to the required repayments, we expect to additionally repay
indebtedness under our credit agreement. In aggregate, we expect to repay our
indebtedness as follows:

• approximately $8.5 million (including a prepayment fee of approximately 
  $45,000) under our PNC Term Loan A facility which had an interest rate of 
  4.76% as of December 31, 2016;                                            

• approximately $1.5 million (including a prepayment fee of approximately 
  $45,000) under our White Oak Term Loan B facility which had an interest rate 
  of 11.0% as of December 31, 2016; and                                

• approximately $0.718 million (including a prepayment fee of approximately 
  $7,000) under our PNC revolving credit facility which had an interest rate of
  3.6% as of December 31, 2016.                                          

Each of the facilities is scheduled to mature on December 23, 2021. We entered
into each of the facilities in December 2016, and the proceeds from the
facilities were used to refinance previously outstanding indebtedness.

From time to time we may engage in discussions concerning acquisitions, but we 
currently have no agreements or commitments to make any material acquisitions.

Subject to the above-referenced contractual requirements to use a portion of the
net proceeds of this offering to pay down amounts outstanding under our current
credit agreement, our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our working capital and
financial flexibility (through the net proceeds of this offering and Acacia’s
exercise of the Acacia Primary Warrant, as well as the conversion of our
outstanding secured debt into shares of common stock), create a public market
for our common stock and enable access to the public equity markets for us and
our stockholders. We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering
for working capital or other general corporate purposes, including funding our
growth strategies discussed in this prospectus. These uses and growth strategies
include investments to expand our platform and enhance our technologies, and to
broaden our sales and marketing capabilities for our SaaS licensing business;
however, we do not currently have any definitive or preliminary plans with
respect to the use of proceeds for such purposes. In addition, we may use a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses, services, technologies or intellectual property
rights. However, we have no agreements or commitments with respect to any such
acquisitions or investments at this time.

Our expected uses of the net proceeds from this offering are based upon our
present plans, objectives and business condition. As of the date of this
prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the
net proceeds from this offering, and management has not estimated the amount of
proceeds, or the range of proceeds, to be used for any particular purpose. The
amounts and timing of our actual uses of net proceeds will vary depending on
numerous factors. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over
the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be
relying on our management’s judgment regarding the application of the net
proceeds.

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering, we may invest the net
proceeds in investment grade, short-term interest-bearing obligations, such as
money-market funds, certificates of deposit, or direct or guaranteed obligations
of the United States government, or hold the net proceeds as cash. We cannot
predict whether any net proceeds invested will yield a favorable return."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the  
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a 
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we        
    received from an affiliate described below. These funds will be repaid out
    of the proceeds of this offering available to us.                               

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer up to $7,350,000 of their underwriting 
    commissions (or $8,452,500 if the underwriters’ overallotment option is      
    exercised in full), which equals 3.5% of the gross proceeds from the units   
    offered to the public (and assumes that all proceeds were raised by the      
    underwriters), until consummation of our initial business combination. Upon  
    consummation of our initial business combination, the deferred commissions   
    will be paid to the underwriters from the funds held in the trust account.
    No discounts, commissions or fees will be paid with respect to the purchase
    of the private warrants.             

(3) Up to $150,000 of the miscellaneous expenses shall be reimbursement to the   
    underwriters for their expenses. 

(4) The amount of proceeds not held in the trust account may increase based on   
    the lower underwriting discounts for units purchased by lead investors. In   
    addition, interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account    
    will be available to us to pay tax obligations. We estimate the interest     
    earned on the trust account will be approximately $80,000 over a 24-month    
    period assuming an interest rate of approximately 0.02% per year. These      
    expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of
    these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we
    may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates
    in connection with negotiating and structuring our initial business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination.
    We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than         
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which       
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific   
    category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital.     

The rules of the Nasdaq Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement warrants, $210,000,000 ($241,500,000 if the over-allotment option is
exercised in full) will be placed in an account in the United States at J.P.
Morgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust
Company, as trustee. The funds held in the trust account will be invested only
in United States government treasury bills, notes or bonds having a maturity of
180 days or less, in money market funds meeting the applicable conditions under
Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940 and that invest
solely in U.S. treasuries, or in demand deposit accounts so that we are not
deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with
respect to interest earned on the funds held in the trust account that may be
released to us to pay our tax obligations, the proceeds will not be released
from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial
business combination or our redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares
if we have not completed a business combination in the required time period. The
proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the
sellers of a target business with which we complete our initial business
combination. Any amounts not paid as consideration to the sellers of the target
business may be used to finance operations of the target business.

The payment to our sponsor of a monthly fee of $10,000 is for general and
administrative services including office space, utilities and secretarial
support. This arrangement is being agreed to by our sponsor for our benefit and
is not intended to provide our officers or directors with compensation in lieu
of a salary. This arrangement will terminate upon completion of our initial
business combination or the distribution of the trust account to our public
shareholders. Other than the $10,000 per month fee, no compensation of any kind
will be paid to our sponsor, members of our management team or any of our or
their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in
connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless
of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive
reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with
activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses,
performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business
combinations as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar
locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Since
the role of present management after our initial business combination is
uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be
paid to those persons after our initial business combination. 

Regardless of whether the over-allotment option is exercised in full, the net
proceeds from this offering available to us out of trust for our working capital
requirements in searching for our initial business combination will be
approximately $1,000,000 (or higher based on lower underwriting discounts for
units purchased by lead investors). In addition, interest earned on the funds
held in the trust account may be released to us to pay tax obligations. The
allocation of the net proceeds available to us outside of the trust account,
along with the available interest earned on the funds held in the trust account,
represents our best estimate of the intended uses of these funds. In the event
that our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may reallocate some of such
proceeds within the above described categories. If our estimate of the costs of
undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating our initial business
combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of
interest available from the trust account is insufficient as a result of the
current low interest rate environment, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such
members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will likely use substantially all of the net proceeds of this offering,
including the funds held in the trust account, to acquire a target business and
to pay our expenses relating thereto. To the extent that our shares are used in
whole or in part as consideration to effect our initial business combination,
the proceeds held in the trust account which are not used to consummate a
business combination will be disbursed to the combined company and will, along
with any other net proceeds not expended, be used as working capital to finance
the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used
in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’s
operations, for development and construction of one or more mining assets, for
strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing
or new products. 

To the extent we are unable to consummate a business combination, we will pay
the costs of liquidation from our remaining assets outside of the trust account.
If such funds are insufficient, our sponsor has agreed to pay the funds
necessary to complete such liquidation (currently anticipated to be no more than
$100,000) and has agreed not to seek repayment of such expenses. 

As of February 10, 2017, an affiliate of our sponsor advanced us an aggregate of
$78,280 to be used for entity formation costs. The advance is non-interest
bearing, unsecured and due on demand. The advance will be repaid out of the
proceeds of this offering available to us for payment of offering expenses. 

On February 10, 2017, we entered into a promissory note with the sponsor,
whereby the sponsor agreed to loan us up to an aggregate of $300,000 to be used
in part for expenses incurred in connection with this offering. The promissory
note is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due on the earlier of June 30, 2017
or the closing of this offering. As of February 10, 2017, no amounts were
outstanding under the promissory note. 

We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have sufficient
available funds to operate for up to the next 24 months, assuming that our
initial business combination is not consummated during that time. However, if
necessary, in order to meet our working capital needs following the consummation
of this offering, our sponsor, officers and directors or their affiliates may,
but are not obligated to, loan us funds, from time to time or at any time, in
whatever amount they deem reasonable in their sole discretion. Each loan would
be evidenced by a non-interest bearing promissory note. The notes would either
be paid upon consummation of our initial business combination, without interest,
or, at the lender’s discretion, up to $1,500,000 of the notes may be converted
upon consummation of our business combination into additional private warrants
at a price of $0.50 per warrant. Our shareholders have approved the issuance of
the warrants and underlying securities upon conversion of such notes, to the
extent the holder wishes to so convert them at the time of the consummation of
our initial business combination. If we do not complete our initial business
combination, the loans will not be repaid. 

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination instead of
conducting a tender offer to allow our public shareholders to seek redemption of
their shares, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their affiliates may
also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either prior to or
following the completion of our initial business combination. However, they have
no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and
have not formulated any terms or conditions for such any transactions. If they
engage in such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are
in possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller
or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We
do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a
tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not complete a business combination that would cause our net tangible
assets to be less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s
“penny stock” rules). The agreement for our business combination, however, may
require as a closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain
amount of cash. If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights
so that we cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or
cash requirements, we would not proceed with the business combination, and
instead may search for an alternate business combination. 

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
(including interest earned on his, her or its portion of the trust account to
the extent not previously released to us) only in the event of (1) our
redemption of 100% of the outstanding public shares if we have not completed a
business combination in the required time period, (2) if that public shareholder
elects to redeem ordinary shares in connection with a shareholder vote to
approve our proposed initial business combination or a vote to amend the
provisions of our memorandum and articles of association relating to
shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity or (3) if that public
shareholder sells shares to us in any tender offer in connection with a proposed
initial business combination. In no other circumstances will a public
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account."

We intend to use the net proceeds to us from this offering to further implement
our expansion strategy, repay a portion of our corporate debt, fund organic

these purposes and our management will have broad discretion over how these
proceeds are used. We are conducting this offering at this time because we 
believe that it will allow us to better execute our expansion strategy. Although
we may, from time to time in the ordinary course of business, evaluate potential
acquisition opportunities that we believe provide attractive risk-adjusted
returns, we do not have any immediate plans, arrangements or understanding
relating to any acquisitions, nor are we engaged in negotiations with any
potential acquisition targets. Likewise, although we regularly consider 
establishing de novo banking locations and organic growth initiatives within our
current and potential new markets, we do not have any immediate plans,
arrangements or understanding relating to the establishment of any de novo
banking locations or any other organic growth initiatives outside of the
ordinary course of business.

We intend to use $19.9 million of the proceeds from this offering to repay in
full the outstanding balance on our line of credit with our correspondent bank.
The line of credit is unsecured and bears interest at the prime rate plus 0.50%,
with interest payable quarterly, and matures in March 2018.

We intend to use $4.5 million of the proceeds from this offering to redeem a
portion of certain debentures issued by the Company in July and December 2015
with an aggregate principal amount of $9.0 million. The debentures have maturity
dates ranging from July 2017 to June 2020, with interest rates varying with the
maturity date. The debentures have a weighted average interest rate of 3.67%,
and interest is payable semi-annually from the date of issuance.

In addition, we intend to contribute approximately $15.0 million of the proceeds
from this offering to the Bank and retain the remaining proceeds at the holding
company level for general corporate purposes."
KKR REAL ESTATE FINANCE TRUST INC.,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/kkr-real-estate-finance-trust-inc-956033-83298,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/kkr-real-estate-finance-trust-inc-956033-83298,424B4,5/8/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12047006,"We estimate that the net proceeds we will receive from this offering, after
deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses
payable by us, will be approximately $191.0 million, or approximately $220.4
million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional
shares of common stock from us.

We plan to use all the net proceeds from this offering to acquire our target
assets in a manner consistent with our investment strategies and investment
guidelines described in this prospectus. We expect to fully deploy the net
proceeds from this offering and the drawdown of the remaining $207.6 million of
equity capital commitments in our target assets, including our commitment to the
aggregator vehicle and future funding obligations, by the end of the first 
quarter of 2018. However, there can be no assurance that we will use all or any
of such proceeds to acquire our target assets by such time. The allocation of
our capital among our target assets will depend on prevailing market conditions
and may change over time in response to opportunities available in different
interest rate, economic and credit environments. Until appropriate investments
can be identified, our Manager may invest the net proceeds from this offering in
money market funds, bank accounts, overnight repurchase agreements with primary
federal reserve bank dealers collateralized by direct U.S. government
obligations and other instruments or investments reasonably determined by our
Manager to be of high quality and that are consistent with our intention to
maintain our qualification as a REIT and maintain our exclusion from
registration under the Investment Company Act. These investments are expected to
provide a lower net return than we seek to achieve from our target assets. In
addition, prior to the time we have fully invested the net proceeds of this
offering to acquire our target assets, we may fund our quarterly distributions,
repurchase shares of our common stock or temporarily reduce amounts outstanding
under our repurchase facilties with a portion of such net proceeds. Affiliates
of Wells Fargo Securities, LLC, Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC, Goldman
Sachs & Co. LLC and J.P. Morgan Securities LLC, each an underwriter in this
offering, are lenders under our master repurchase agreements and may receive a
portion of the net proceeds of this offering, to the extent amounts outstanding
under the applicable master repurchase agreements are reduced."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                          

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of $300,000 as described in this prospectus. These loans   
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of    
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering       
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, $21,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’      
    deferred commissions (or up to $24,150,000 if the underwriters’             
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be   
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on   
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                        
 
(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current         
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business         
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry       
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We  
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific  
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect the trust account 
    to generate approximately $1,200,000 of interest annually following the     
    investment of such funds in specified U.S. Government Treasury bills or in  
    specified money market funds; however, we can provide no assurances         
    regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an interest rate of 0.2% per   
    annum based upon current yields of securities in which the trust account may
    be invested. In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in          
    connection with an intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an 
    affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but  
    are not obligated to, loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our  
    initial business combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the 
    proceeds of the trust account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be
    repaid only out of funds held outside the trust account. In the event that  
    our initial business combination does not close, we may use a portion of the
    working capital held outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts 
    but no proceeds from our trust account would be used to repay such loaned   
    amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans may be convertible into warrants of 
    the post business combination entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the 
    option of the lender. The warrants would be identical to the private        
    placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The terms of such loans by our    
    sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of our officers and directors,
    if any, have not been determined and no written agreements exist with       
    respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans from parties other    
    than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do not believe third  
    parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a waiver against any 
    and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust account.                
 
(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    initial business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment   
    fees for financing.                                                         

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$600,000,000 (or $690,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $21,000,000 (or up to $24,150,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
placed in a non-interest bearing U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee. 
The funds in the trust account will be invested only in U.S. government treasury
bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting
certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest
only in direct U.S. government treasury obligations. Based on current interest
rates, we estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be 
approximately $1,200,000 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.2% per year,
following the investment of such funds in specified U.S. government treasury
bills or in specified money market funds. We will not be permitted to withdraw 
any of the principal or interest held in the trust account except for the 
withdrawal of interest to fund our working capital requirements, subject to an
annual limit of $750,000, and/or to pay our taxes, the proceeds from this 
offering and the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released 
from the trust account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial 
business combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly 
submitted in connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and 
restated certificate of incorporation to modify the substance and timing of our
obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial
business combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering and
(iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete
our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law. 

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transactioncompany, the payment of principal
or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 to be
used for a portion of the expenses related to the organization of our company
and this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the
earlier of August 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. This loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be converted into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. However, such persons have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a
closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
If too many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend our amended and restated certificate
of incorporation to modify the substance or timing of our obligation to redeem
100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business combination
within 24 months from the closing of this offering and (iii) the redemption of
all of our public shares if we are unable to complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering, subject to
applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders, officers
and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to
complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."

$67.0 million (or approximately $77.5 million if the underwriters exercise in
full their option to purchase up to 750,000 additional shares of common stock to
cover over-allotments), after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our capitalization and
financial flexibility, establish a public market for our common stock and to
facilitate future access to the public equity markets by us, our employees and
our stockholders, obtain additional capital to support our operations, and
increase our visibility in the marketplace. 

We currently intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with
our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows: 

• approximately $35 million to conduct and complete a Phase 2 STARS trial of 
  OV101 in adults with Angelman syndrome and a Phase 1 trial in OV101 in     
  adolescents with Angelman syndrome or Fragile X syndrome, as well as other 
  future Phase 2 trials in adolescents and pediatrics in these indications;  

• approximately $17 million to conduct and complete a Phase 1b/2a trial of OV935
  in patients with epileptic encephalopathies;                         

• approximately $7 million for other ongoing research and development activities
  related to additional drug candidates and preclinical programs; and
 
• the remainder to fund the expansion of patient-focused activities, including
  social media outreach and involvement, and for business development, working
  capital and general corporate purposes.               

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based on our current plans and business conditions, which could
change in the future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Further, due
to the uncertainties inherent in the drug development process, it is difficult
to estimate with certainty the exact amounts of the net proceeds from this
offering that may be used for the above purposes. Our management will have broad
discretion over the use of the net proceeds from this offering, and our
investors will be relying on the judgment of our management regarding the
application of the net proceeds of this offering. The amounts and timing of our
expenditures will depend upon numerous factors including the results of our
research and development efforts, the timing and success of preclinical studies
and any ongoing clinical trials or clinical trials we may commence in the
future, the timing of regulatory submissions and the amount of cash obtained
through current and any future collaborations. 

Our strategic plan includes the intent to expand our portfolio of drug
candidates through business development. We believe opportunities may exist from
time to time to expand our current business through acquisitions or in-licenses
of complementary companies, medicines or technologies. While we have no existing
agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific future acquisitions
or in-licenses at this time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these
purposes. 

The expected net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash and cash
equivalents, will not be sufficient for us to fund any of our drug candidates
through regulatory approval, and we will need to raise additional capital to
complete the development and commercialization of our drug candidates. We expect
to finance our cash needs through a combination of equity offerings, debt
financings and potential collaborations, license and development agreements. We
have based these estimates on assumptions that may prove to be incorrect, and we
could expend our available capital resources at a rate greater than we currently
expect. 

Pending the use of the net proceeds from this offering as described above, we
intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing investment-grade
securities or government securities."

this offering will be approximately $51.6 million, after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable

ordinary shares in full, we estimate that the net proceeds to us from this
offering will be approximately $59.7 million, after deducting the underwriting
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our existing
cash resources, to advance our clinical pipeline, including specifically:

. approximately $17.0 million to complete our single pivotal Phase 3 clinical 
  trial of MitoGel for the treatment of low-grade UTUC;                      

. approximately $14.0 million to file an IND for, and to initiate our Phase 2b

  general corporate purposes.                                          

Due to the uncertainties inherent in the clinical development and regulatory
approval process, it is difficult to estimate with certainty the exact amounts
of the net proceeds from this offering that may be used for any of the above
purposes on a stand-alone basis.

Pending our application of the net proceeds from this offering, we plan to
invest such proceeds in depositary institutions."

this offering will be approximately $152.9 million, or approximately $176.4 
million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, based 
upon the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, after deducting 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash, as follows:

• approximately $73.1 million to fund continued research and development of
  rimegepant, including initiating and completing our two planned Phase 3 
  clinical trials for the acute treatment of migraine, and initiating our 
  planned long-term safety study of rimegepant;

• approximately $24.2 million to fund continued research and development of
  BHV-3500 for the prevention of chronic and episodic migraine;

• approximately $9.6 million to complete our ongoing Phase 2/3 clinical trial of
  trigriluzole for the treatment of SCA;

• approximately $10.3 million to fund continued research and development of
  BHV-5000 for the treatment of breathing irregularities associated with Rett
  syndrome, including completion of our planned Phase 1 clinical trial for this
  indication;

• approximately $5.6 million to repay aggregate indebtedness under our credit 
  agreement with Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, or Wells Fargo, and our
  notes payable to related parties;

• approximately $4.1 million to satisfy our remaining obligation to purchase 
  shares of capital stock of Kleo Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a privately held 
  preclinical-stage company; and

• the remainder to fund other research and development activities, including the
  development of BHV-0223 for the treatment of ALS, as well as for working 
  capital and other general corporate purposes, including the satisfaction of 
  any milestone payment obligations under our license agreements.

In the ordinary course of our business, we expect to from time to time evaluate
the acquisition of, investment in or in-license of complementary products,
technologies or businesses, and we could use a portion of the net proceeds from
this offering for such activities. We currently do not have any agreements, 
arrangements or commitments with respect to any potential acquisition, 
investment or license, other than the Kleo investment described above.

This expected use of net proceeds from this offering represents our intentions
based upon our current plans and business conditions, which could change in the
future as our plans and business conditions evolve. Predicting the cost 
necessary to develop product candidates can be difficult and the amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous 
factors, including the progress of our development, the status of and results 
from clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with third 
parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs.

Based on our current operational plans and assumptions, we expect that the net
proceeds from this offering, together with our existing cash, will be sufficient
to fund our operations through October 31, 2018, including the repayment of our
outstanding debt, and, with respect to our planned and ongoing clinical trials,
will be sufficient to enable us to complete our two planned Phase 3 clinical 
trials of rimegepant and complete our Phase 2/3 clinical trial of trigriluzole.
However, we expect that we will require additional funds to complete the 
development of rimegepant for the acute treatment of migraine, including for the
completion of our planned long-term safety study. With respect to the continued
research and development of BHV-3500 and BHV-5000, we expect that we may require
additional funds as these programs progress, the amounts of which will depend on
the ultimate clinical development paths we pursue. However, our plans and 
assumptions could be wrong and we may need to raise additional capital in order
to complete our planned and ongoing trials and any potential future trials that
may be required by regulatory authorities. We may need to raise additional 
capital through public and private equity offerings, debt financings, strategic
partnerships, alliances and licensing arrangements, or a combination of the 
above.

We incurred the indebtedness under the one-year credit agreement with Wells 
Fargo in August 2016 in the principal amount of $5.0 million to satisfy our
payment obligations under our license agreement with BMS. The one-year credit
agreement matures on August 30, 2017, and borrowings under the agreement bear
interest at a rate equal to monthly LIBOR plus 1.50% per annum. As of
December 31, 2016, the interest rate applicable to the borrowings under the
one-year credit agreement was 2.27% per annum. In connection with this credit
agreement, Wells Fargo required that we obtain a personal guaranty of our loan
obligations from one of our directors, John Childs. Another one of our
directors, Gregory Bailey, provided a further guaranty related to the credit
agreement. We incurred the indebtedness under our notes payable in the aggregate
amount of $0.6 million in consideration for the acquisition of 100% of the
capital stock of BPI on December 31, 2016. We issued the notes to the holders of
the capital stock of BPI, which consisted of Declan Doogan, the chairman of our
board of directors; family trusts associated with Vlad Coric, our chief
executive officer and one of our directors; and a family trust associated with
Robert Berman, our chief medical officer. The notes mature on December 31, 2021,
but are mandatorily payable upon the consummation of this offering, and the
interest on the notes accrues at a rate of 4.5% per annum.

As of December 31, 2016, we owned approximately 18.6% of the outstanding shares
of Kleo and two of our outside directors serve as Kleo directors, resulting from
our arm's-length investment in Kleo in August 2016. In connection with our 
initial investment, we committed to make additional investments totaling $5.5
million in Kleo, subject to certain conditions, and in March 2017, we satisfied
our first purchase obligation by purchasing 1,375,000 shares of Kleo common
stock for cash consideration of $1.4 million.

Our management will have broad discretion in the application of the net proceeds
from this offering, and investors will be relying on the judgment of our 
management regarding the application of the net proceeds from this offering. The
timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many factors,
including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our business.
Pending these uses, we plan to hold these net proceeds in non-interest bearing
accounts, with the goal of capital preservation and liquidity so that such funds
are readily available to fund our operations."

  approximately $3.0 million to fund our Phase 2a PTCL trial and approximately
  $3.0 million to fund our Phase 1/1b AML/MDS trials;

• approximately $30.0 million to $35.0 million to fund the potential expansion

  related to ALRN-6924 and research related to our platform and other programs;

expenditures may vary significantly depending on numerous factors, including the
progress of our development and commercialization efforts, the status of and
results from clinical trials, any collaborations that we may enter into with
third parties for our product candidates and any unforeseen cash needs.
Moreover, our estimates of the costs to fund our trials are based on the current
designs of the trials. If we were to modify the design of any of these trials,
for instance, to increase the number of patients in the trials, our costs to
fund the trials could increase. As a result, our management will retain broad
discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Based on our current plans, we believe that our existing cash, cash equivalents
and investments, together with the net proceeds from this offering, will be
sufficient to enable us to fund our operating expenses and capital expenditure
requirements through the second quarter of 2019. We have based this estimate on
assumptions that may prove to be wrong, and we could use our available capital
resources sooner than we currently expect. We expect that the net proceeds from
this offering and our existing cash, cash equivalents and investments will be
sufficient to enable us to complete each of our ongoing clinical trials. We do
not expect that the net proceeds from this offering and our existing cash, cash
equivalents and investments will be sufficient, however, to enable us to conduct
through completion any additional clinical trials of ALRN-6924 or to otherwise

(1) Includes amounts payable to public shareholders who properly redeem their   
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business 
    combination.                                                                

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of loans
    from our sponsor of $300,000 as described in this prospectus. These loans   
    will be repaid upon completion of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of    
    offering proceeds that has been allocated for the payment of offering       
    expenses (other than underwriting commissions) and amounts not to be held in
    the trust account. In the event that offering expenses are less than as set
    forth in this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working
    capital expenses. In the event that the offering expenses are more than as
    set forth in this table, we may fund such excess with funds not held in the
    trust account.     

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, $14,000,000, which constitutes the underwriters’      
    deferred commissions (or up to $16,100,000 if the underwriters’             
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be   
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working        
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on   
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.                        

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all  
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, 
    we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current 
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In    
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a      
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We 
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than    
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which      
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust    
    account. Based on current interest rates, we would expect the trust account 
    to generate approximately $800,000 of interest annually following the       
    investment of such funds in specified U.S. Government Treasury bills or in  
    specified money market funds beginning in January 2018; however, we can  
    provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an       
    interest rate of 0.2% per annum based upon current yields of securities in  
    which the trust account may be invested. In addition, in order to finance   
    transaction costs in connection with an intended initial business           
    combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor or certain of our   
    officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us funds as may  
    be required. If we complete our initial business combination, we would repay
    such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust account released to us.
    Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds held outside the  
    trust account. In the event that our initial business combination does not  
    close, we may use a portion of the working capital held outside the trust   
    account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our trust account 
    would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of such loans  
    may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination entity at 
    a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants would
    be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The   
    terms of such loans by our sponsor, affiliate of our sponsor, or certain of 
    our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
    agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not expect to seek loans
    from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our sponsor as we do
    not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds and provide a
    waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our trust     
    account.                                                                    

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our     
    initial business combination to fund a ‘no shop” provision and commitment 
    fees for financing.                                                         

The rules of the NYSE provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from this
offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the net
proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
$400,000,000 (or $460,000,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is
exercised in full), including $14,000,000 (or up to $16,100,000 if the
underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred
underwriting commissions, will, upon the consummation of this offering, be
placed in a non-interest bearing U.S.-based trust account at J.P. Morgan Chase
Bank, N.A., with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee.
Beginning in January 2018, the funds in the trust account will be invested only
in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or less or in
money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under the 
Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury 
obligations. Based on current interest rates, we estimate that the interest
earned on the trust account will be approximately $800,000 per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.2% per year, following the investment of such funds in 
specified U.S. government treasury bills or in specified money market funds
beginning in January 2018. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the
principal or interest held in the trust account except for the withdrawal of 
interest to fund our working capital requirements, subject to an annual limit of
$750,000, and/or to pay our taxes, if any, the proceeds from this offering and
the sale of the private placement warrants will not be released from the trust
account until the earliest of (i) the completion of our initial business 
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance and timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months, as
applicable) and (iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are
unable to complete our initial business combination within 24 months from the
closing of this offering (or 27 months, as applicable), subject to applicable
law.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
equity or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the consideration in connection with our initial
business combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the
trust account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or
expansion of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of
principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial
business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working
capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $20,000 per month for office
space, administrative and support services. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees.

Prior to the closing of this offering, our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 to be
used for a portion of the expenses related to the organization of our company
and this offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and due at the
earlier of August 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. This loan will be
repaid upon the closing of this offering out of the $2,000,000 of offering
proceeds not held in the trust account.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post business combination
entity at a price of $1.50 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants issued to our sponsor. The
terms of such loans by our officers and directors, if any, have not been 
determined and no written agreements exist with respect to such loans. We do not
expect to seek loans from parties other than our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor as we do not believe third parties will be willing to loan such funds
and provide a waiver against any and all rights to seek access to funds in our
trust account.

If we seek shareholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our initial business combination
pursuant to the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors
or their affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated
transactions or in the open market either prior to or following the completion
of our initial business combination. However, such persons have no current
commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such transactions and have not
formulated any terms or conditions for any such transactions. If they engage in
such transactions, they will not make any such purchases when they are in
possession of any material non-public information not disclosed to the seller or
if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M under the Exchange Act. We do
not currently anticipate that such purchases, if any, would constitute a tender
offer subject to the tender offer rules under the Exchange Act or a
going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules under the Exchange
Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any such purchases that
the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will comply with such
rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets, after payment of the deferred underwriting commissions, to be
less than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our initial business combination may require as a
closing condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) the completion of our initial business
combination, (ii) the redemption of any public shares properly submitted in
connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated memorandum
and articles of association to modify the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering (or 27 months
from the closing of this offering if we have executed a letter of intent,
agreement in principle or definitive agreement for an initial business
combination within 24 months from the closing of this offering but have not
completed the initial business combination within such 24-month period)
(iii) the redemption of all of our public shares if we are unable to complete
our initial business combination within 24 months from the closing of this
offering (or 27 months, as applicable), subject to applicable law. In no other
circumstances will a public shareholder have any right or interest of any kind
to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have entered into a letter agreement with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial shareholders, officers
and directors have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating distributions
from the trust account with respect to their founder shares if we fail to
complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time frame.
However, if our sponsor or any of our officers, directors or affiliates acquires
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."
"ESQUIRE FINANCIAL HOLDINGS, INC.",https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/esquire-financial-holdings-inc-873795-83849,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/esquire-financial-holdings-inc-873795-83849,424B4,6/27/2017,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=12146347,"Based on the public offering price of $14.00 per share, we estimate that the
net proceeds from the sale of the shares of common stock by us will be
approximately $21.9 million (or approximately $26.5 million if the underwriter
exercises in full its option to purchase additional shares of common stock from
us), after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and
estimated offering expenses payable by us.

In order to maintain our capital and liquidity ratios at acceptable levels while
we continue to grow our balance sheet with commercial real estate loans and
commercial loans, we have decided to undertake a public offering at this time.
Additionally, our lending limit is expected to increase by $4.0 million
following the completion of this offering, which will allow us to originate
larger loans and be more competitive in the market place.

We intend to use the net proceeds of the offering to support the growth in
Esquire Bank’s loan portfolio, including the possibility of making larger loans
due to our increased legal lending limit, to finance potential strategic
acquisitions to the extent such opportunities arise and for other general
corporate purposes, which could include other growth initiatives. We have no
current plans, arrangements or understandings relating to any specific
acquisition or similar transaction and management has not yet determined the
types of businesses that they might target.

Our management will retain broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds of this
offering, and the precise amounts and timing of our use of the net proceeds of
this offering will depend upon market conditions, as well as other factors.
Until we deploy the proceeds of this offering for the uses described above, we
expect to hold such proceeds in short-term investments.

offering will be approximately $30.5 million, or approximately $34.5 million if
the underwriters exercise their option to purchase additional shares in full,
after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated
offering expenses payable by us.

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering as
follows:

• approximately $16 million to fund our continued clinical research and
  development initiatives in connection with IV Tramadol;

• approximately $6 million to pay off our debts to Fortress and NSC; and

• for general corporate purposes.

These expected uses represent our intentions based on our current plans and
business conditions, which could change in the future as our plans and business
conditions evolve. The timing and amounts of our actual expenditures will depend
on several factors, including data results, progression of our clinical
development programs as well as our joint collaborations, and any unforeseen
cash needs.

As of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with absolute certainty all
of the particular uses for the net proceeds to us from the offering.
Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in the application of
proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds in
short-term and long-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

shares of common stock in this offering at the initial public offering price of
$19.50 per share will be approximately $181.3 million, after deducting
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses of
approximately $13.7 million (or, if the underwriters exercise their option in
full, approximately $208.9 million, after deducting underwriting discounts and
commissions and estimated offering expenses of approximately $15.3 million).

We plan to use all the net proceeds from this offering as described above to 
fund future funding obligations of $231.5 million in the aggregate of 
investments in our Initial Portfolio and to acquire additional target
investments in accordance with our objectives and strategies described in this
prospectus. As of the date of this prospectus, we have issued non-binding term
sheets representing aggregate loan amounts, including any future fundings, of 
approximately $575 million and have received signed non-binding term sheets 
representing aggregate loan amounts, including any future fundings, of 
approximately $285 million which, if closed, will be funded in part with the net
proceeds from this offering. Prior to such assets being acquired, we may invest
the net proceeds from this offering in interest-bearing short-term investments,
including money market accounts that are consistent with our intention to 
qualify as a REIT. These investments are expected to provide a lower net return
than we will seek to achieve from our target investments."

(1) Includes amounts payable to public stockholders who properly redeem their
    shares in connection with our successful completion of our initial business
    combination.

(2) A portion of the offering expenses have been paid from the proceeds of a
    loan from our sponsor of $300,000. This loan will be repaid upon completion
    of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that has been
    allocated for the payment of offering expenses other than underwriting
    commissions. In the event that offering expenses are less than set forth in
    this table, any such amounts will be used for post-closing working capital
    expenses.

(3) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to
    approximately 3.5% of the gross proceeds of this offering (or approximately
    3.8% of the gross proceeds of this offering if the over-allotment option is
    exercised in full). Upon completion of our initial business combination, up
    to approximately $7.9 million, which constitutes the underwriters’ deferred
    commissions (or up to approximately $9.7 million if the underwriters’
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds, less
    amounts released to the trustee to pay redeeming stockholders, will be
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all
    of these items may differ from the estimates set forth in this prospectus.
    For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our
    current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. If the
    over-allotment option is exercised in full, we will have available
    approximately $1,762,000 of funds held outside the trust account for our
    expenses.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

(6) We will pay Mr. Petruska, our Chief Financial Officer, $25,000 per month for
    his services prior to the consummation of our initial business combination,
    of which 50% is payable upon the successful completion of our initial
    business combination. Does not include deferred fees payable to
    Messrs. Hennessy and Charlton, our Chief Executive Officer and President,
    respectively, all payable upon the successful completion of our initial
    business combination, as described elsewhere in this prospectus.

The rules of the NYSE MKT provide that at least 90% of the gross proceeds from
this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust account. Of the
net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private placement warrants,
approximately $227,250,000 (or approximately $261,337,500 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to approximately $7.9
million (or up to approximately $9.7 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting commissions, will be
placed in a trust account with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting
as trustee and will be invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a
maturity of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions
under Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct
U.S. government treasury obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on
the trust account will be approximately $2.1 million per year, assuming an
interest rate of 0.94% per year. We will not be permitted to withdraw any of the
principal or interest held in the trust account, except for the withdrawal of
interest to pay taxes, until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of our public shares in connection
with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-initial
business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of 100% of our public
shares if we are unable to complete a business combination within 18 months from
the closing of this offering (subject to the requirements of law).

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using equity or
debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are
used for payment of the consideration in connection with our business
combination, we may apply the balance of the cash released from the trust
account for general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion
of operations of the post-transaction company, the payment of principal or
interest due on indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business
combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

We will enter into an Administrative Services Agreement pursuant to which we
will pay an affiliate of our sponsor a total of $15,000 per month for office
space, utilities and secretarial support. Upon completion of our initial
business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly
fees. We will also pay Messrs. Hennessy, Charlton and Petruska, our management
team, as described elsewhere in this prospectus.

Our sponsor has loaned us $300,000 for a portion of the expenses of this
offering. This loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier
of December 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering. This loan will be repaid
upon the closing of this offering out of the $750,000 of offering proceeds that
has been allocated to the payment of offering expenses.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such loans may be convertible into warrants of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $1.00 per warrant at the option of the lender. The warrants
would be identical to the private placement warrants. The terms of such loans by
our officers and directors, if any, have not been determined and no written
agreements exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the sellers or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon consummation of our initial
business combination (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock”
rules) and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described in this prospectus, (ii) the redemption of our public shares in
connection with a stockholder vote to amend any provisions of our amended and
restated certificate of incorporation relating to stockholders’ rights or
pre-initial business combination activity or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares if we are unable to complete our business combination within 18 months
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described in this prospectus and any limitations (including but not limited to
cash requirements) created by the terms of the proposed business combination. In
no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of
any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial stockholders have entered into letter agreements with us, pursuant
to which they have agreed to waive their redemption rights with respect to their
founder shares and public shares in connection with the completion of our
initial business combination. In addition, our initial stockholders have agreed
to waive their rights to liquidating distributions from the trust account with
respect to their founder shares if we fail to complete our business combination
within the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our
officers, directors or affiliates acquires public shares in or after this
offering, they will be entitled to liquidating distributions from the trust
account with respect to such public shares if we fail to complete our initial
business combination within the prescribed time frame."

million (approximately $235.8 million if the underwriters exercise their option
to purchase additional shares in full). iStar has agreed to pay the underwriting
discounts and commissions payable to the underwriters in connection with this 
offering, our other offering expenses and our expenses incurred in connection
with the concurrent iStar placement, in an aggregate amount not to exceed $25
million. After deducting the estimated expenses of this offering not paid by
iStar, we expect to receive net proceeds from this offering of approximately
$201.4 million (or approximately $232.2 million if the underwriters exercise
their option to purchase additional shares in full). In addition, concurrently
with the completion of this offering, we will sell to iStar 2,250,000 shares of
our common stock in the concurrent iStar placement at the initial public
offering price per share in this offering, resulting in total net proceeds to us
of $246.4 million from this offering and the concurrent iStar placement.

We expect to use approximately $142.0 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering and the concurrent iStar placement to purchase the acquisition GNLs. 
iStar entered into definitive purchase agreements for each of the acquisition 
GNL transactions in May 2017. We will assume the purchase agreements at the 
closing of this offering or, if iStar has acquired the acquisition GNLs before 
the closing of this offering, we will acquire the acquisition GNLs from iStar 
shortly after the completion of this offering. The closings of the purchases of 
the acquisition GNLs are subject to customary conditions, and there can be no 
assurance that either of the transactions will occur. If an acquisition GNL 
transaction does not occur for any reason, we will instead use the net proceeds
intended for such transaction for general business purposes.

We will contribute the net proceeds from this offering and the concurrent iStar
placement to our operating partnership in exchange for a number of operating
partnership units equal to the number of shares of our common stock issued in 
this offering and the concurrent iStar placement. The following table sets forth
the estimated sources and estimated uses of funds by our operating partnership 
that we expect in connection with this offering and the concurrent iStar 
placement.

(1) We expect to enter into our new $300 million revolving credit facility at
    the closing of this offering that will bear interest at an annual rate of
    LIBOR plus 1.35% and will mature in May 2020.

As indicated in the table above, net proceeds remaining after purchasing the 
acquisition GNLs, paying the new revolving credit facility costs and transaction
expenses identified above not paid by iStar will be used for general business 
purposes, including future acquisitions and originations of GNLs. Pending the
use of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest such proceeds in
interest-bearing accounts and short-term, interest-bearing securities in a 
manner that is consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to finance the repayment of
the remaining portion of the outstanding debt to HCI and for general corporate
purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, such as
manufacturing integration and product expansion into new markets. As described
elsewhere in this prospectus, in June 2016 and November 2016, the Company sold
to HCI two OID debentures in the principal amounts of $2,500,000 and $937,500,
respectively. Each of the 2016 OID Debentures have a maturity date of June 30,
2018 and have an interest rate of 12%. The Company used the proceeds from the
June 2016 OID (i) to make a one hundred percent (100%) distribution for payment
of unsecured claims in accordance with the Company’s plan of reorganization,
(ii) to pay all costs of the administration of SGB’s bankruptcy, (iii) to pay
all amounts owed under the 2015 debtor-in-possession loan and (iv) for general
working capital purposes. The Company used the proceeds from the November 2016
OID for general working capital purposes."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds we 
    borrowed from the sponsor. These funds will be repaid out of the proceeds of
    this offering available to us.

(2) No discounts or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the
    private units.

(3) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the 
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to 
    acquiring a target business, including a cash fee payable to 
    EarlyBirdCapital equal to 3% of the gross proceeds of this offering.

(4) We will pay our independent directors an annual retainer in an aggregate of
    $38,400 (to be prorated for a partial term), payable in arrears commencing
    on the first anniversary of the closing of this offering and ending on the 
    earlier of the consummation of our initial business combination and our 
    liquidation.

A total of $10.25 per share (whether or not the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under 
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S. 
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us 
(net of taxes payable) to fund our working capital requirements, as discussed 
below, none of the funds held in the trust account will be released from the 
trust account until the earlier of: (i) the consummation of our initial business
combination within 21 months from the closing of this offering and (ii) a 
redemption to public shareholders prior to any voluntary winding-up in the event
we do not consummate our initial business combination within the applicable 
period.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, or the amount of interest available to use
from the trust account is minimal as a result of the current interest rate
environment, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount,
availability and cost of which is currently unascertainable. In this event, we
could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from
members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not
under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay an affiliate of
our sponsor a total of $5,000 per month for office space, utilities and
secretarial and administrative services. Upon completion of our initial business
combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has advanced to us a total of
$1,804 and loaned to us a total of $300,000 to be used for a portion of the
expenses of this offering. The advance is non-interest bearing and is payable on
demand. The loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due on the earlier of
December 31, 2017 or the closing of this offering.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $500,000 of such
loans may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00 per
unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 55,000
ordinary shares if $500,000 of notes were so converted as the rights included in
the units would result in an additional 5,000 shares being issued, as well as
25,000 warrants to purchase 25,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001. Furthermore, the redemption
threshold may be further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial
business combination. In such case, we would not proceed with the redemption of
our public shares or the business combination, and instead may search for an
alternate business combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate
our initial business combination within 21 months following the closing of this
offering, subject to applicable law, or (iii) if we seek to amend our memorandum
and articles of association to affect the substance or timing of our obligation
to redeem all public shares if we cannot complete an initial business 
combination within 21 months of the closing of this offering and such amendment
is duly approved and registered. In no other circumstances will a public 
shareholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to any shares they own in connection with the consummation of our
initial business combination, including their founder shares, private shares and
public shares that they have purchased during or after the offering, if any. In
addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their rights to
liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares and private shares
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within 21 months from
the closing of this offering. However, if our initial shareholders acquire
public shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to receive
liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares if we fail to
consummate our initial business combination within the required time period."

(1) A portion of the offering expenses, including the SEC registration fee, the 
    FINRA filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the Nasdaq listing fee and a
    portion of the legal and audit fees, have been paid from the funds advanced 
    to us by Mr. Shukla, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. These funds  
    are currently due on demand and will be repaid out of the proceeds of this  
    offering available to us.                                                   

(2) The underwriters have agreed to defer underwriting commissions equal to 3.5%
    of the gross proceeds of this offering. Upon completion of our initial      
    business combination, up to $4,375,000, which constitutes the underwriters’ 
    deferred commissions (or up to $5,031,250 if the underwriters’ 
    over-allotment option is exercised in full) will be paid to the underwriters
    from the funds held in the trust account, and the remaining funds will be   
    released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price
    of the business or businesses with which our initial business combination   
    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or 
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business   
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working 
    capital. Up to $0.05 per unit (or up to $625,000) of the deferred 
    underwriting commissions (or up to $718,750, depending upon the extent to 
    which the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised) may be paid, 
    solely at the discretion of our management team, to third parties not 
    participating in this offering, that assist us in consummating our initial 
    business combination. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest
    accrued on the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions. No discounts
    or commissions will be paid with respect to the purchase of the private 
    units.                                               

(4) Upon closing of the initial business combination, the funds held in the 
    trust account may, but need not, be used to pay our expenses relating to    
    acquiring a target business.                                                

(5) Does not include any interest earned on the funds held in the trust account 
    that may be available to us as described in this prospectus.                

A total of $126,250,000 (or $145,187,500 if the underwriters’ over-allotment
option is exercised in full) of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale
of the private units described in this prospectus will be placed in a trust
account in the United States at JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., maintained by
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills, notes and bonds with a maturity
of 180 days or less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under
Rule 2a-7 under the Investment Company Act and which invest solely in U.S.
Treasuries. Except for all interest income that may be released to us to pay
taxes and up to $50,000 to pay dissolution expenses, as discussed below, none of
the funds held in the trust account will be released from the trust account
until the earlier of: (1) the completion of our initial business combination
within the required time period; (2) our redemption of 100% of the outstanding
public shares if we have not completed an initial business combination in the
required time period; and (3) the redemption of any public shares properly
tendered in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within the required time period or (B) with respect
to any other provision relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business
combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our initial
business combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using
shares or debt securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust
account are used for payment of the purchase price in connection with our
business combination, we may apply the cash released from the trust account that
is not applied to the purchase price for general corporate purposes, including
for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired businesses, the payment
of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating the
initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies or for
working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of our initial business
combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due
diligence and negotiating our initial business combination is less than the
actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional
capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently
unascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through
loans or additional investments from members of our sponsor or an affiliate of
our sponsor or our officers and directors, but such members of our management
team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us.

Commencing on the date that our securities are first listed on Nasdaq, we have
agreed to pay our sponsor a total of $10,000 per month for office space,
utilities and secretarial and administrative services. Upon completion of our
initial business combination or our liquidation, we will cease paying these
monthly fees.

As of May 16, 2017, Mr. Shukla, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer has
advanced to us a total of $217,133 to be used for a portion of the expenses of
this offering. These advances are non-interest bearing and unsecured. The
advance is due on demand.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to, loan us
funds as may be required. If we consummate our initial business combination, we
would repay such loaned amounts. In the event that the initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the offering proceeds held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,500,000 of
such notes may be convertible into additional private units at a price of $10.00
per unit (which, for example, would result in the holders being issued 165,000
ordinary shares if $1,500,000 of notes were so converted (including 15,000
shares upon the closing of our initial business combination in respect of
150,000 rights included in such units), as well as 150,000 warrants to purchase
75,000 shares).

In no event will we redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our
net tangible assets to be less than $5,000,001 upon the consummation of our
initial business combination. Furthermore, the redemption threshold may be
further limited by the terms and conditions of our initial business combination.
If too many public shareholders exercise their redemption rights so that we
cannot satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public shareholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our consummation of our initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those ordinary shares that such
shareholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations described
herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to consummate
our initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this
offering (or 21 months, as applicable), or (iii) the redemption of our public
shares in connection with a shareholder vote to amend our amended and restated
memorandum and articles of association (A) to modify the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we do not complete our
initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering
(or 21 months, as applicable) or (B) with respect to any other provision
relating to shareholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, subject
to applicable law. In no other circumstances will a public shareholder have any
right or interest of any kind to or in the trust account.

Our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their redemption rights with
respect to their founder shares, private shares and shares underlying private
rights and private warrants in connection with the consummation of our initial
business combination. Our initial shareholders have also agreed to waive their
redemption rights with respect to any public shares purchased during or after
the offering in connection with the consummation of our initial business
combination. In addition, our initial shareholders have agreed to waive their
rights to liquidating distributions with respect to its founder shares if we
fail to consummate our initial business combination within 18 months from the
closing of this offering (or 21 months, as applicable). However, if our initial
shareholders acquire public shares in or after this offering, they will be
entitled to receive liquidating distributions with respect to such public shares
if we fail to consummate our initial business combination within the required
time period."

at the public offering price of $13.00 per share and after deducting the
estimated underwriting discounts and commissions of $3,811,923 and approximately
$850,000 of our estimated expenses related to this offering (or approximately
$4,704,423 of underwriting discounts and commissions and $900,000 of our
estimated expenses if the underwriters exercise their option to purchase
additional shares in full).

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering as follows:

. Funding future billboard acquisitions. We regularly consider possible     
  acquisitions in out-of-home advertising. Our strategy is to continue to make
  acquisitions in this business sector at least consistent with the level of
  acquisitions conducted during the prior 24 months in which we completed 10
  acquisitions and one exchange for a total purchase price of $28,879,774. We
  anticipate that many of these acquisitions will be of smaller to medium-sized
  billboard operations, consistent with our prior acquisitions. 

. Expanding our insurance activities. We expect to increase capital reserves
  to levels we anticipate may be needed in the next 24 months to expand the  
  scope of our current surety insurance and related brokerage operations as we
  seek to expand our ability to conduct business in other states and expand the
  size of our surety insurance services. To date, we have focused our efforts in
  the surety insurance field by acquiring both Warnock and by completing last
  December the acquisition of UC&S, a Treasury Listed, AM Best A-(“Excellent”)
  rated surety insurance company. Since the acquisition of UC&S, we have 
  increased the number of states in which UC&S is authorized to issue surety 
  insurance from 9 to 33 and the District of Columbia and we currently have
  pending applications with the 17 remaining states in which we have not yet 
  received authority to conduct business. Since January 1, 2017, we have
  utilized $2.75 million of our capital to increase our capital reserves as
  requested by state regulators. In addition, we have expended approximately
  $100,000 in state filing fees with respect to such applications. We may also
  consider making acquisitions in other insurance lines. We anticipate that any
  such acquisitions would be of insurance businesses similar in many respects to
  surety, including but not limited to high volume and low policy limit 
  insurance businesses. In addition, we may seek opportunities to further expand
  our distribution capabilities in serving as a broker selling surety and other
  insurance products.           

. Expanding our investments in real estate management businesses. We also expect
  to expand our investments in real estate management businesses. During the
  prior 18 months, we made investments totaling $994,398.   

. Acquisition of other businesses. We may also consider acquisitions of     
  businesses other than those involved in billboards, surety insurance and real
  estate management. In considering any such acquisition, our strategy is to 
  acquire businesses with durable revenues and cash flow and that will produce
  an acceptable return on invested capital over time.                

We intend to use any remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, which
may include capital expenditures and other working capital needs. We believe
opportunities may exist from time to time to expand our current business through
acquisitions of companies in either of our existing business lines or in future
unrelated businesses which we may wish to pursue. While we have no current
agreements, commitments or understandings for any specific acquisitions at this
time, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for these purposes.

Based on our current plans, we believe our cash, cash equivalents and short-term
investments, together with the net proceeds to us from this offering and the
anticipated cash flows generated from our existing businesses, will be
sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next 12 months.

This expected use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our
intentions based upon our current plans and business conditions and numerous
factors, including the factors described under “Risk Factors.” As of the date of
this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for
the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this offering or the
amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above. The amounts and
timing of our actual expenditures and the use of these proceeds may vary
significantly depending on numerous factors, including the progress of our
expansion efforts and acquisition activities, as well as any unforeseen cash
needs. As a result, our management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering.

Pending our use of the net proceeds from this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in a variety of investment-grade, short-term, interest-bearing
securities."

this offering will be approximately $55.8 million, or $64.9 million if the
underwriters fully exercise their option to purchase additional shares, at the
initial public offering price of $11.00 per share, and after deducting the
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable
by us.

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial
flexibility, create a public market for our common stock, and to facilitate our
access to the public equity markets. We currently expect to use the net proceeds
from this offering as follows:

• Approximately $28 million for Phase 3 clinical trials of Oraxol for treatment
  of metastatic breast cancer;                                    

• Approximately $6 million for additional clinical development and regulatory 
  activities for our Orascovery platform;                        

• Approximately $20 million for Phase 3 clinical trials of KX-01 ointment for 
  treatment of actinic keratosis; and                                   

• The remainder for clinical and pre-clinical research and development working 
  capital, capital expenditures and general corporate purposes.     

We may use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering for the acquisition or
licensing, as the case may be, of additional technologies, other assets or
businesses, or for other strategic investments or opportunities, although we
have no definitive understandings, agreements or commitments to do so as of the
date hereof.

Our expected use of the net proceeds from this offering is based upon our
present plans and business condition. Based on those current plans and
assumptions, we do not expect that the net proceeds from this offering, combined
with our current operating capital, will be sufficient to enable us to complete
all necessary development or commercially launch our current drug candidates. As
of the date of this prospectus, we cannot predict with certainty all of the
particular uses for the net proceeds to be received upon the completion of this
offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth above.
The amounts and timing of our actual use of proceeds will vary depending on
numerous factors. As a result, management will retain broad discretion over the
allocation of the net proceeds from this offering, and investors will be relying
on the judgment of our management regarding the application of the net proceeds.

Pending the use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in high-quality, short-term interest-bearing obligations,
investment-grade instruments, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed
obligations of the U.S. government."

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds from this offering,
together with our existing cash and cash equivalents, as follows:

· approximately $2 million to advance the clinical development of IMM-124E for

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our financial

future access to the capital markets. We intend to use approximately
$13.6 million of the net proceeds from this offering to pay all of our
outstanding debt, including approximately $0.1 million of early termination
fees, with Orix Growth Capital, LLC, formerly known as Orix Ventures LLC, which
bears interest at the greater of: (i) the average prime rate in effect during
each month or (ii) the average three-month LIBOR rate during such month, plus
2.5% per annum, plus 7.5% with a minimum rate of 11%. We expect to use the 
remaining net proceeds from this offering for working capital and other general
corporate purposes, including investments in sales and marketing in the United
States and internationally and in research and development. We also may use a 
portion of the net proceeds from this offering for acquisitions or strategic 
investments in complementary businesses or technologies, although we do not 
currently have any plans for any such acquisitions or investments. We have not
allocated specific amounts of net proceeds for any of these purposes.

We cannot predict with certainty all of the particular uses for the proceeds of
this offering or the amounts that we will actually spend on the uses set forth
above. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in applying
the net proceeds of this offering following the repayment of our outstanding 
debt. The timing and amount of our actual expenditures will be based on many 
factors, including cash flows from operations and the anticipated growth of our
business. Pending their use, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this

    occurs or for general corporate purposes, including payment of principal or
    interest on indebtedness incurred in connection with our initial business
    combination, to fund the purchases of other companies or for working
    capital. The underwriters will not be entitled to any interest accrued on
    the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions.

(4) These expenses are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or
    all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For 
    example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current
    estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring a business 
    combination based upon the level of complexity of such business combination.
    In the event we identify an acquisition target in a specific industry 
    subject to specific regulations, we may incur additional expenses associated
    with legal due diligence and the engagement of special legal counsel. In 
    addition, our staffing needs may vary and as a result, we may engage a 
    number of consultants to assist with legal and financial due diligence. We
    do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than
    fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which 
    fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific
    category of expenses, would not be available for our expenses. The amount in
    the table above does not include interest available to us from the trust
    account to pay our taxes. Based on the current interest rate environment, we
    would expect approximately $353,500 per year to be available to us from 
    interest earned on the funds held in the trust account over 18 months (or 21
    months, as applicable) following the closing of this offering; however, we
    can provide no assurances regarding this amount. This estimate assumes an 
    interest rate of 0.35% per annum based upon current yields of securities in
    which the trust account may be invested.

(5) Includes estimated amounts that may also be used in connection with our
    business combination to fund a “no shop” provision and commitment fees for
    financing.

The rules of the NASDAQ Capital Market provide that at least 90% of the gross
proceeds from this offering and the private placement be deposited in a trust
account. Of the net proceeds of this offering and the sale of the private
placement units, $101,000,000 (or $116,150,000 if the underwriters’
over-allotment option is exercised in full), including up to $3,500,000 (or up
to $4,025,000 if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full)
of deferred underwriting commissions, will be placed in a trust account with
Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company acting as trustee and will be
invested only in U.S. government treasury bills with a maturity of 180 days or
less or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 under
the Investment Company Act which invest only in direct U.S. government treasury
obligations. We estimate that the interest earned on the trust account will be
approximately $353,500 per year, assuming an interest rate of 0.35% per year. We
will not be permitted to withdraw any of the principal or interest held in the
trust account, except for the withdrawal of interest to pay taxes (and $50,000
reserved for liquidation expenses if we do not successfully complete our initial
business combination), until the earlier of (i) the completion of our initial
business combination, (ii) the redemption of 100% of our public shares if we are
unable to complete a business combination within 18 months from the closing of
this offering (or 21 months, as applicable) (subject to the requirements of law)
or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection with a stockholder
vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated certificate of
incorporation (A) that would affect the substance or timing of our obligation to
redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an initial business
combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering (or 21 months, as
applicable) or (B) with respect to any other provision relating to stockholders’
rights or pre-business combination activity.

The net proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay
the sellers of a target business with which we ultimately complete our business
combination. If our initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt
securities, or not all of the funds released from the trust account are used for
payment of the consideration in connection with our business combination, we may
apply the balance of the cash released from the trust account for general
corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of the
post-transaction company, the payment of principal or interest due on
indebtedness incurred in completing our initial business combination, to fund
the purchase of other companies or for working capital.

We believe that amounts not held in trust will be sufficient to pay the costs
and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the
fact that while we may begin preliminary due diligence of a target business in
connection with an indication of interest, we intend to undertake in-depth due
diligence, depending on the circumstances of the relevant prospective
acquisition, only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or
other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of a business combination.
However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and
negotiating a business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to
do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability
and cost of which is currently unascertainable. If we are required to seek
additional capital, we could seek such additional capital through loans or
additional investments from our sponsor, members of our management team or their
affiliates, but such persons are not under any obligation to advance funds to,
or invest in, us.

As of the date of this prospectus, our sponsor has loaned us $140,000 of up to
$200,000 to be used for a portion of the expenses of this offering. This loan is
non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of June 30, 2017 or
the closing of this offering. This loan will be repaid upon the closing of this
offering out of the $500,000 of offering proceeds that has been allocated to the
payment of offering expenses.

Commencing on the date of this prospectus, we have agreed to pay our sponsor a
total of $10,000 per month for office space, utilities and secretarial and
administrative support. Upon completion of our initial business combination or
our liquidation, we will cease paying these monthly fees.

In addition, in order to finance transaction costs in connection with an
intended initial business combination, our sponsor or an affiliate of our
sponsor or certain of our officers and directors may, but are not obligated to,
loan us funds as may be required. If we complete our initial business
combination, we would repay such loaned amounts out of the proceeds of the trust
account released to us. Otherwise, such loans would be repaid only out of funds
held outside the trust account. In the event that our initial business
combination does not close, we may use a portion of the working capital held
outside the trust account to repay such loaned amounts but no proceeds from our
trust account would be used to repay such loaned amounts. Up to $1,000,000 of
such loans will be convertible into units of the post-business combination
entity at a price of $10.00 per unit (which, for example, would result in the
holders being issued 110,000 shares of common stock if $1,000,000 of notes were
so converted since the 100,000 rights included in such units would result in the
issuance of 10,000 shares upon the closing of our business combination, as well
as 100,000 warrants to purchase 50,000 shares) at the option of the lender. The
units would be identical to the private placement units. No written agreements
exist with respect to such loans.

If we seek stockholder approval of our initial business combination and we do
not conduct redemptions in connection with our business combination pursuant to
the tender offer rules, our sponsor, directors, officers, advisors or their
affiliates may also purchase shares in privately negotiated transactions either
prior to or following the completion of our initial business combination.
However, they have no current commitments, plans or intentions to engage in such
transactions and have not formulated any terms or conditions for any such
transactions. If they engage in such transactions, they will not make any such
purchases when they are in possession of any material non-public information not
disclosed to the seller or if such purchases are prohibited by Regulation M
under the Exchange Act. We do not currently anticipate that such purchases, if
any, would constitute a tender offer subject to the tender offer rules under the
Exchange Act or a going-private transaction subject to the going-private rules
under the Exchange Act; however, if the purchasers determine at the time of any
such purchases that the purchases are subject to such rules, the purchasers will
comply with such rules.

We may not redeem our public shares in an amount that would cause our net
tangible assets upon consummation of our initial business combination to be less
than $5,000,001 (so that we are not subject to the SEC’s “penny stock” rules)
and the agreement for our business combination may require as a closing
condition that we have a minimum net worth or a certain amount of cash. If too
many public stockholders exercise their redemption rights so that we cannot
satisfy the net tangible asset requirement or any net worth or cash
requirements, we would not proceed with the redemption of our public shares or
the business combination, and instead may search for an alternate business
combination.

A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account
only upon the earlier to occur of: (i) our completion of an initial business
combination, and then only in connection with those shares of our common stock
that such stockholder properly elected to redeem, subject to the limitations
described herein, (ii) the redemption of our public shares if we are unable to
complete our business combination within 18 months (or 21 months, as applicable)
following the closing of this offering, subject to applicable law and as further
described herein or (iii) the redemption of our public shares in connection with
a stockholder vote to approve an amendment to our amended and restated
certificate of incorporation (A) that would affect the substance or timing of
our obligation to redeem 100% of our public shares if we have not consummated an
initial business combination within 18 months from the closing of this offering
(or 21 months, as applicable) or (B) with respect to any other provision
relating to stockholders’ rights or pre-business combination activity, and any
limitations (including but not limited to cash requirements) created by the
terms of the proposed business combination. In no other circumstances will a
public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust
account.

Our sponsor, officers, directors and the underwriters have entered into letter
agreements with us, pursuant to which they have agreed to waive their redemption
rights with respect to their founder shares, private placement shares and
(except for the underwriters) public shares in connection with the completion of
our initial business combination. In addition, our sponsor, officers and
directors and the underwriters have agreed to waive their rights to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to their founder shares and
private placement shares if we fail to complete our business combination within
the prescribed time frame. However, if our sponsor or any of our officers,
directors or the underwriters or their respective affiliates acquire public
shares in or after this offering, they will be entitled to liquidating
distributions from the trust account with respect to such public shares if we
fail to complete our initial business combination within the prescribed time
frame."
