$88.9 million or approximately $102.6 million if the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full, after deducting the underwriting discount 
and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

      We do not have any specific plans or proposals for the allocation of the 
net proceeds from this offering, other than using $20.0 million of the net 
proceeds from this offering to repay our outstanding subordinated unsecured 
convertible promissory note payable to Nortel Networks. The Nortel note would 
accrue interest at a rate of 7% per year beginning on February 7, 2005 and 
would become due and payable on February 7, 2009. The Nortel note would 
accelerate and become due and payable, at Nortel’s option, upon our change in 
control, as defined in the Nortel note. The Nortel note also becomes due and 
payable, to the extent provided in the Nortel note, upon equity financings such 
as this offering. 

      We expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds from this offering for 
general corporate purposes, including: 

   
   •   working capital;  
   
   •   sales and marketing expenses;  
   
   •   research and development expenses;  
   
   •   general and administrative expenses;  
   
   •   capital expenditures; and  
   
   •   possible joint ventures with, investments in or acquisitions of 
businesses, products or technologies that complement our business.  


      Although we may use a portion of the net proceeds to enter into joint 
ventures, investments or acquisitions with respect to businesses, products or 
technologies that are complementary to our business, we have no current plans 
in this regard. Pending such uses, we plan to invest the net proceeds in 
short-term investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

approximately $187.7 million, or approximately $216.0 million if the
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. Such estimates are
based on an initial public offering price of $9.25 per share. The amounts
listed below include balances as of July 2, 2003 and take into account
prepayment fees.

   We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering as follows:

   o Repayment of promissory notes issued upon exchange of trust certificates of
     seven trusts, due in June and July 2005, bearing interest at 12% per annum.
     The seven trusts were originally controlled by affiliates of ours. The
     trusts were formed for the purpose of acquiring monitoring contracts. The
     note holders are comprised of non-affiliated investors. All of such
     indebtedness was incurred by IASI.                                             $ 25.2 million

   o Repayment of bank debt, due through May 1, 2005, bearing interest at various
     rates from 8.0% to 12.5% per annum. The debt is due to Key Bank, N.A. and
     was incurred for the purpose of acquiring central stations, wholesale
     monitoring contracts, and for working capital. All of such indebtedness was
     incurred by KC Acquisition.                                                    $ 24.7 million

   o Repayment of subordinated debt, due on dates ranging from April 1, 2005 to
     April 1, 2007, bearing interest at rates ranging from 10.10% to 12.50% per
     annum. The subordinated debt is from a collection of investment trusts
     created for the purchase of monitoring contracts, and were originally
     controlled by affiliates of ours. The debt is payable to non-affiliated
     investors. All of such indebtedness was incurred by IASI.                      $  9.2 million

   o Repayment of subordinated debt, due on June 1, 2006, bearing interest at
     12.5% per annum. This debt is from an investment trust controlled by an
     affiliate of ours. The trust was formed for the purpose of acquiring
     monitoring contracts. The debt is payable to non-affiliated accredited
     investors. All of such indebtedness was incurred by IASI.                      $  6.2 million

   o Repayment of promissory notes to Lynn A. Smith, the wife of one of our
     directors, bearing interest at 6.25% and 12% per annum, and due in March
     2004 and January 2004, respectively. One of the notes ($3.0 million) is debt
     incurred by KC Acquisition, and the other ($3.0 million) is debt incurred by
     IASI prior to its acquisition in January. A portion ($2.0 million) of the
     proceeds of the $3.0 million indebtedness incurred by IASI was loaned by
     IASI to KC Acquisition.                                                        $  6.0 million

   o Repayment of debt, due on December 1, 2005, bearing interest at a variable
     interest rate, which is currently 6.75%. This debt is due to Security
     Leasing Partners, L.P., an unaffiliated third-party, and was created for the
     purpose of acquiring monitoring contracts. This indebtedness was incurred by
     IASI.                                                                          $  3.7 million

   o Repayment of debt to various lenders, due on dates ranging from May 1, 2003
     to April 1, 2006, bearing interest at rates ranging from 8.0% to 12.0% per
     annum. The debt is due to Key Bank, N.A., BSB Bancorp, and 15 investment
     trusts not exchanged for promissory notes of IASI. In the aggregate 38% of
     the 41 trusts' certificates were not exchanged for promissory notes. The
     investment trusts were created for the purchase of monitoring contracts, and
     were originally controlled by affiliates of ours. The debt is payable to
     non-affiliated investors. All of such indebtedness was incurred by IASI.       $  3.6 million

   o Repayment of debt to M&S Partners, an entity controlled by Messrs. Smith and
     McGinn. This indebtedness was assumed from M&S Partners by IASI.               $  0.9 million

   o Repayment of debt to Royal Thoughts, LLC, due in January, 2004, bearing
     interest of 9.0% per annum. Curt Quady, an Executive Vice President and his
     family own a majority of Royal Thoughts. This indebtedness was incurred by
     KC Acquisition in connection with the acquisition of the 5.3% interest in
     Royal Thoughts.                                                                $  0.6 million

                                                                                    --------------

                                                                                    --------------
    Proceeds intended for purchases of alarm monitoring contracts. This
      represents the estimated cash portion of the net proceeds that management
      believes it will expend to acquire additional alarm monitoring contracts.
      The cost of the alarm monitoring contracts to be acquired will be
      determined by arms length negotiations between management and the owners
      of such contracts. None of such contracts is owned by any of our
      affiliates.                                                                   $104.6 million

    Working capital and general corporate purposes                                  $  3.0 million

    Total Uses:                                                                     $187.7 million

   All of the debt to be repaid from the proceeds of this offering is related
to the purchase of alarm monitoring contracts, central stations, Dealer
relationships or was utilized for working capital. Other than Royal Thoughts,
Lynn A. Smith, and M&S Partners, none of the holders of our debt to be repaid
from the proceeds of this offering is an affiliate of ours or related to one
of our affiliates. In total, 64.7% of the debt to be repaid with this offering
was incurred by entities that were affiliated with us prior to their
acquisition in January. Management will have broad discretion in the
application of the net proceeds allocated to working capital and other general
corporate purposes."

offering will be approximately $89.1 million, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our 
net proceeds will be approximately $102.8 million. 

      The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future 
access to the public equity markets. In addition, we plan to repay out of the 
net proceeds of this offering the entire balance of our outstanding debt, which 
consists of the following as of June 30, 2003: 

   
   •   approximately $6.8 million outstanding under a revolving line of credit 
with a bank, which carries an interest rate of 5.25% (the prime rate of 4.25% 
plus 1.0%) and matures in January 2004;  
   
   •   approximately $3.3 million outstanding under an equipment term loan with 
the same bank, which carries an interest rate of 5.5% (the prime rate of 4.25% 
plus 1.25%), with each draw payable over 36 months from the date of the draw, 
with the last draw maturing in June 2006;  
   
   •   approximately $580,000 outstanding under a secured loan agreement with a 
financing company, which carries an interest rate of 17.5% and matures in 
January 2004; and  
   
   •   approximately $230,000 outstanding under a secured loan agreement with 
a financing company, which carries an interest rate of 16.9% and matures in 
January 2004.  


      We anticipate that we will use the remaining net proceeds for general 
corporate purposes, including working capital and capital expenditures, but we 
have not designated any specific uses. We may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds to fund possible investments in, or acquisitions of, complementary 
businesses, products or technologies or establishing joint ventures. We have no 
current agreements or commitments with respect to any investment, acquisition 
or joint venture, and we currently are not engaged in negotiations with respect 
to any investment, acquisition or joint venture. Accordingly, our management 
will have broad discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 
Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term 
interest-bearing, investment grade securities, certificates of deposit or 
direct or guaranteed obligations of the U.S. government."

proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, including working 
capital and capital expenditures. We currently anticipate spending a portion of 
the net proceeds on sales and marketing activities, research and development 
activities, general and administrative matters and on capital expenditures. We 
have not yet allocated specific amounts for these purposes. In addition, we may 
use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in complementary

We have no commitments with respect to any acquisition or investment, and we

enhance our ability to acquire other businesses, products or technologies, to 
create a public market for our common stock, to facilitate our future access to 
public equity markets, to provide liquidity for our existing stockholders, to 
improve the effectiveness of our stock option plans in attracting and retaining 
key employees, to increase the visibility of our company in a marketplace in 
which several of our competitors are publicly-held companies and to provide our 
OEM customers greater assurances as to our long-term viability, which is 
enhanced by being subject to the financial reporting and disclosure obligations 
of a public company. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will 
depend on numerous factors, including the status of our product development

full and our existing stockholders sell an aggregate of 324,590 of these shares), 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and our estimated

stock by the selling stockholders who propose to sell up to an aggregate of 
324,590 shares of common stock to the underwriters in the event the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option. However, we will sell an

to the public offering price less underwriting discounts and commissions. 

      The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
to create a public market for our common stock, and to facilitate our future 
access to the public equity markets. We intend to use approximately 
$21.3 million of the net proceeds of this offering to redeem all outstanding 
shares of our redeemable preferred stock and to pay all accrued but unpaid 
dividends on such shares through the date of redemption. This approximate 
$21.3 million amount represents the aggregate amount of payments made to redeem 
all 7,800,891 shares of our redeemable preferred stock outstanding at the 
original issuance price of $2.019 per share, plus accrued but unpaid dividends 
thereon accumulating at 8% per annum through October 24, 2002 and at 10% per
annum from October 25, 2002 through the redemption date. We expect to use the 
remaining portion of the net proceeds from the offering for general corporate

market expansion, and sales and marketing efforts. We may also use the net 
proceeds of this offering to acquire or invest in complementary businesses,

obtain the right to use such complementary technologies. We have no commitments

by our operations, and competition. We will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation and use of the balance of the net proceeds. Pending the uses 
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We believe that our available 
cash, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to 
meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months."

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future access to 
public debt and equity markets. As of the date of this prospectus, we have no 
specific plans to use the net proceeds from this offering (including the 
over-allotment option, if exercised) other than as set forth below: 

  

   ·     repay amounts borrowed under our credit facility,  

  

   ·     pursue selective acquisitions of health plans and contracts for 
government sponsored health programs in existing and new markets,  

  

   ·     purchase of common stock by our contemplated employee stock ownership 
plan from existing stockholders or alternatively our redemption of an 
equivalent number of shares from such stockholders,  

  

   ·     increase our enrollment in existing markets through enrollment 
initiatives, and  

  

   ·     general corporate purposes, including working capital.  

  

We have not determined the amount of net proceeds to be used specifically for 
the foregoing purposes. As a result, management will have broad discretion over 
the use of the proceeds from this offering. Pending any such uses, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in interest bearing securities. 

  

Borrowings from our $75.0 million credit facility will be used for acquisitions, 
enrollment initiatives and general corporate purposes. In March 2003, we 
borrowed $5.0 million under the credit facility, of which $3.4 million was used 
to repay a mortgage note payable on our headquarters building in April 2003. 
The principal amounts borrowed under the credit facility will be due in three 
years. The interest rate per annum will be (a) LIBOR plus a margin between 225 
and 275 basis points or (b) the higher of (i) Bank of America prime or (ii) the 
federal funds rate plus 0.50%, plus a margin between 125 and 175 basis points. 
The interest rate margins will be reduced if the proceeds of this offering are 
in excess of $50.0 million. 

  

We intend to use approximately $19.6 million of the proceeds of this offering 
to either finance the purchase of our common stock from existing stockholders 
by our contemplated employee stock ownership plan, or redeem an equivalent 
number of shares from such stockholders, within ninety days after the closing 
of this offering at the then fair market value of the common stock. The terms 
of a loan to the trustee of the employee stock ownership plan have not been 
finalized. 

  

In January and February 2003, we redeemed 1,201,174 shares of our common stock 
at $16.98 per share from Janet M. Watt, Josephine M. Battiste, the Mary R. 
Molina Living Trust, the Mary Martha Molina Trust (1995), the Janet M. Watt 
Trust (1995) and the Josephine M. Molina Trust (1995). These stockholders held 
a combined interest of 40.0% prior to the redemption, which was reduced to 
36.2%. The total cash payment of $20,390,000 was made from available cash 
reserves. The remainder beneficiaries of the Mary R. Molina Living Trust are 
J. Mario Molina, M.D., John C. Molina, J.D., M. Martha Bernadett, M.D., Janet 
M. Watt and Josephine M. Battiste."

Jefferson Bancshares may use the proceeds it retains from the offering: 

  

   •     to invest in securities;  

  

   •     to pay dividends to shareholders;  

  

   •     to repurchase shares of its common stock;  

  

   •     to finance the possible acquisition of financial institutions or other 
businesses that are related to banking; and  

  

   •     for general corporate purposes.  

  
Under current Office of Thrift Supervision regulations, we may not repurchase 
shares of our common stock during the first year following conversion, except 
to fund stock-based benefit plans or, with prior regulatory approval, when 
extraordinary circumstances exist. 

  
Jefferson Federal may use the proceeds that it receives from the offering, 
which is shown in the table above as the amount contributed to Jefferson 
Federal: 

  

   •     to fund new loans;  

  

   •     to invest in securities;  

  

   •     to finance the possible expansion of its business activities, 
including developing new branch locations; and  

  

   •     for general corporate purposes.  

We may need regulatory approvals to engage in some of the activities listed 
above. We currently have no specific plans or agreements regarding any 
expansion activities or acquisitions, although we have identified potential 
branch locations. 
  

Except as described above, neither Jefferson Bancshares nor Jefferson Federal 
has any specific plans for the investment of the proceeds of this offering. 
Although Jefferson Federal’s capital currently exceeds regulatory requirements, 
we are conducting the conversion primarily to structure our business in the 
form of organization used by commercial banks and most other financial services 
companies."

shares, before deducting the underwriting discount and estimated expenses, will 
be $60 million. Because the Bank has agreed to pay all the expenses of this 
offering, the entire gross proceeds from the offering will be available to us. 
At the completion of the offering, we intend to use all of the offering 
proceeds plus an additional 10,658,329 of our common shares to acquire from the 
Bank 152 single family residential mortgage loans and 37 multifamily mortgage 
loans with an aggregate outstanding principal balance of approximately 
$120 million. 

  
The Bank from time to time repurchases its common shares in open market and 
other transactions, and expects to continue to do so in the future. In addition, 
subject to regulatory approval, the Bank expects to use approximately 50% of 
the proceeds to retire existing Tier 1 and/or Tier 2 capital. Specifically, the 
Bank expects to redeem approximately $6.5 million of its outstanding 
subordinated debentures and plans to purchase on the open market up to 
$23.5 million of our Series A preferred shares, our Series B preferred shares 
or subordinated notes that it has issued. The completion of this offering will 
increase the Bank’s capital base, thereby supporting its future growth, and is 
expected to lower the after tax cost of the Bank’s regulatory capital. The net 
funds received by the Bank from this series of transactions will be used for 
its general corporate purposes."

        $17,850,000, or $20,685,000 if the underwriters' over-allotment option 
is exercised in full, of net proceeds will be placed in a trust fund maintained 
by Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, New York, New York, as trustee. 
The proceeds will not be released from the trust fund until the earlier of the 
completion of a business combination or our liquidation. 

        The payment to 400 Building LLC, an affiliate of Arthur Spector, our 
chairman, chief executive officer and president, of a monthly fee of $7,500 is 
for general and administrative services including office space, utilities and 
secretarial support. We believe, based on rents and fees for similar services 
in the Philadelphia metropolitan area, that the fee charged by 400 Building LLC 
is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. 

        We intend to use the excess working capital (approximately $390,000) 
for director and officer liability insurance premiums (approximately $125,000 
for the twenty-four month period commencing on the date of this prospectus), 
with the balance being held in reserve in the event due diligence, legal, 
accounting and other expenses of structuring and negotiating business 
combinations exceed our estimates. 

        To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as 
consideration to effect a business combination, the proceeds held in the trust 
fund as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the 
operations of the target business. 

        Arthur Spector, our chairman of the board, chief executive officer and 
president, has advanced to us approximately $35,000 which was used to pay a 
portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for 
SEC registration fee, NASD registration fee and legal fees and expenses. These 
advances will be repaid out of the gross proceeds of this offering. 

        The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust fund and not 
immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested in 
general debt obligations of the United States Government or other high-quality, 
short-term interest-bearing investments so that we are not deemed to be an 
investment company under the Investment Company Act. The interest income 
derived from investment of these net proceeds during this period will be used 
to defray our general and administrative expenses, as well as costs relating to 
compliance with securities laws and regulations, including associated 
professional fees, until a business combination is completed. 

        We believe that, upon consummation of this offering, we will have 
sufficient available funds to operate for at least the next 24 months, assuming 
that a business combination is not consummated during that time. 

        Commencing on the effective date of this prospectus through the 
consummation of the acquisition of the target business, we will pay 
400 Building LLC, the fee described above. Other than this $7,500 per month 
administrative fee, no compensation of any kind (including finders and 
consulting fees) will be paid to any of our existing stockholders, or any of 
their affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with 
the consummation of the business combination. In addition, our existing 
stockholders will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred 
by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying 
potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business 
combinations. Since the role of present management after a business combination 
is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will 
be paid to those persons after a business combination. 

        A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust 
fund (including interest earned on her portion of the trust fund) only in the 
event of our liquidation or if she were to seek to convert her shares into cash 
in connection with a business combination which she voted against and which we 
actually consummate. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have 
any right or interest of any kind to or in the trust fund."

stockholders. This indebtedness bears interest at the rate of 13.5% per annum,

revolving line of credit, which bears interest at a variable rate equal to the 
prime rate plus 2.0% per annum, is due December 31, 2006 and was incurred in 
January 2003 to replace our prior credit facility;  

  

   •     approximately $2.2 million to repay amounts drawn on our acquisition 
line of credit, which bears interest at a variable rate equal to the prime rate 
plus 2.5% per annum, is due January 1, 2006 and was incurred in January 2003 to 
fund a portion of the acquisition price of Cypress Management Services, Inc.;  

  

   •     approximately $1.5 million to redeem convertible indebtedness to 
Philip Bredesen and Andrea Conte, JTWROS, who are together one of our principal 
stockholders. This indebtedness bears interest at the rate of 8.0% per annum, 
is due March 1, 2007 and was incurred in March 2002 in connection with our 
acquisition of Camelot Care Corporation;  

  

   •     approximately $1.1 million to pay the accrued and unpaid dividends on 
our Series A, B and D preferred stock, which accrues a dividend of 8.0% per 
annum through the date of the consummation of this offering. All of the Series 
A and 94% of the Series B preferred stock is owned by Eos Partners SBIC, L.P. 
and all of the Series D preferred stock is owned by Eos Partners SBIC II, L.P., 
both of which are principal stockholders of Providence and also affiliates of 
Mark First and Brian Young, two of our current directors;  

  

   •     approximately $1.0 million to repay indebtedness, which bears interest

   •     approximately $1.0 million to pay a financial advisory fee to Eos 
Partners SBIC and Eos Partners SBIC II;  

  

   •     approximately $0.9 million to repay indebtedness, which bears interest 
at a variable rate equal to the prime rate plus 2.5% per annum, is due January 
1, 2006 and was incurred for general corporate purposes;  

  

   •     approximately $0.8 million to pay the principal and interest due 
during the first 12 months following this offering on a $3.5 million 
subordinated note to be issued to Eos Partners SBIC and Eos Partners SBIC II 
upon the consummation of this offering. This note is being issued to evidence 
our obligation to pay them a $3.5 million consent fee in connection with this 
offering. The note will bear interest at the rate of 4.0% per annum, payable 
quarterly commencing September 30, 2003, and will be payable in five equal 
semi-annual principal payments of $700,000 commencing June 30, 2004;  

  

   •     approximately $0.4 million to repay our capital lease obligations; and  

  

   •     the balance of approximately $9.7 million for general corporate 
purposes, including potential acquisitions.  

In the event the over-allotment option is exercised, we may use the 
$0.8 million in net proceeds allocated to the current portion of the 
$3.5 million subordinated note to be issued to Eos Partners SBIC and Eos 
Partners SBIC II in connection with this offering, plus $2.7 million of the 
additional net proceeds received from the exercise of the over-allotment option, 
to prepay the entire $3.5 million subordinated note as of the consummation of 
the over-allotment option.
  

Pending the application of the net proceeds, we expect to invest the proceeds 
in short-term, interest bearing, investment-grade marketable securities or 
money market obligations."

this offering after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from shares of our common stock sold 
by the selling stockholders in this offering. 

      We intend to use the net proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
including to finance the growth of our business. We may also use a portion of 
the proceeds for acquisitions or for the opening of select banking locations. 
However, we have no present understanding, agreement or definitive plans 
relating to any specific acquisitions or openings of any banking locations, 
other than the anticipated opening of our banking center in Houston in 
September 2003. 

      The principal purposes of this offering are to raise capital, create a 
public market for our common stock, enhance our ability to acquire other 
businesses, products and technologies and facilitate future access to public 
securities markets. 

      We have not yet determined the amount of net proceeds to be used 
specifically for each of the foregoing purposes mentioned above. Accordingly, 
our management will have significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds 
of the offering. Pending their use as described above, we may invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in interest-bearing investment-grade instruments or 
bank deposits."

$91.1 million ($104.9 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment 
option in full) after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated 
offering expenses payable by us. We expect to use the net proceeds of this 
offering to buy commercial and industrial real estate for lease to tenants, 
to make industrial and commercial mortgage loans and to reimburse our Adviser 
for the expenses and fees it incurs in connection with our business. As of the 
date of this prospectus, we do not have commitments to purchase any properties 
or make any mortgage loans. We will invest the net proceeds in accordance with 
our investment objectives and policies. We estimate that it will take approximately 
18 months for us to substantially invest the net proceeds of this offering, 
depending on the availability of appropriate opportunities and market 
conditions. Pending such investment, we will primarily invest the net proceeds 
in REIT-qualified money market instruments, short-term repurchase agreements or 
other cash equivalents that are expected to provide a lower net return than we 
hope to achieve from our intended real estate investments. We may also 
temporarily invest in securities that qualify as “real estate assets” under the 
REIT provisions of the Internal Revenue Code, such as mortgage-backed 
securities. There can be no assurance that we will be able to achieve our 
targeted investment pace.

approximately $71.6 million based on the initial public offering price of 
$21 per share, after deducting the underwriting discount and estimated offering 
expenses we must pay. If the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option, 
our net proceeds will not change since the over-allotment shares will be 
provided from selling shareholders and not us. We will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders. 

      We intend to utilize approximately $45.0 million to further capitalize 
our insurance subsidiaries, which will enable us to reduce the level of quota 
share reinsurance. For the first three months of 2003, we ceded 46.0% of our 
gross premiums written to unaffiliated reinsurers. As a result of the increase 
in capital resulting from this offering, we will be able to retain more of the 
risk we write, thereby reducing our need for the use of quota share reinsurance. 

      Additionally, we intend to use a portion of the proceeds from this offering 
to repay our two term loans. Approximately $5.0 million will be used to repay our 
term loan from First Tennessee Bank National Association and Hibernia National 
Bank, which has a maturity date of June 30, 2004 and bears interest at an 
annual rate of 9%. Approximately $2.7 million will be used to repay our second 
term loan from First Tennessee Bank, which has a maturity date of December 31, 
2005 and bears interest at an annual rate of 9%. Proceeds from these loans have 
been used to capitalize our insurance subsidiaries, to finance past 
acquisitions and for general corporate purposes. We will use the balance of our 
proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes. 

      Further, we intend to use approximately $7.0 million of the net proceeds 
from this offering to complete the acquisition of an inactive insurance company, 
the only assets of which are insurance licenses to conduct life or accident and 
health insurance business in 44 states. 

      The above discussion represents our best estimate of the allocation of 
the net proceeds from this offering based on our current plans. Actual 
expenditures may vary from these estimates, and we may find it necessary or 
advisable to reallocate the net proceeds from this offering within the 
above-described categories."

common stock in this offering, at the initial public offering price of $14.50 
per share, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other 
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $212.0 million. If the 
underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that the 
net proceeds, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and other 
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $241.0 million. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares of our common stock by the selling 
shareholders. 

      We intend to use all of the net proceeds of this offering to repay 
indebtedness under our commercial paper conduit credit facilities. We 
anticipate that we will use the additional borrowing capacity created by the 
repayments under these credit facilities to fund our lending business in 
connection with newly originated and existing loans in our portfolio as the 
need arises. We intend to use approximately $43.0 million of the net proceeds 
of this offering to repay all of the outstanding indebtedness under our 
$115 million commercial paper conduit credit facility with an affiliate of 
Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC, one of the underwriters, under which Wachovia 
Capital Markets, LLC serves as administrative agent and purchaser agent. This 
facility was established, and the amounts to be repaid were originally drawn, 
concurrently with our acquisition of a pool of loans in 2003. As of June 30, 
2003, $73.7 million was outstanding under this facility that accrued interest 
at a rate of 2.72%. We will use the remainder of the net proceeds, or 
approximately $169.0 million, to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 
primary $700 million commercial paper conduit credit facility with five 
commercial banks, for which Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC serves as 
administrative agent. An affiliate of Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC has a 50% 
interest in this facility and will receive its proportionate share of the 
amounts repaid on this facility. During the last year, we borrowed money under 
this facility to fund our lending business as required in connection with newly 
originated and existing loans in our portfolio. As of June 30, 2003, 
$481.5 million was outstanding under this facility that accrued interest at a 
rate of 2.37%."

common stock in this offering, after deducting estimated offering expenses and 
underwriting discounts and commissions of $29.0 million payable by us, will be 
approximately $389.0 million. 

        We intend to use substantially all of our net proceeds from this 
offering to first repay amounts outstanding under our tranche B term loan, then 
to repay amounts outstanding under the revolving portion of our credit facility, 
with any remaining proceeds used to repay amounts outstanding under our tranche 
A term loan. Any net proceeds used to repay amounts outstanding under our 
tranche A and tranche B term loans will reduce the outstanding commitments 
under our credit facility and we will not be able to reborrow these amounts. 
Any net proceeds used to repay amounts outstanding under our revolving credit 
facility will not reduce the outstanding commitment under the revolving portion 
of our credit facility. Under the terms of our credit facility, the term loans 
are repayable in quarterly installments with the final quarterly installment of 
the tranche A term loan due on June 26, 2008 and the final quarterly 
installment of the tranche B term loan due on June 26, 2009. Loans outstanding 
under the revolving portion of our credit facility must be repaid on June 26, 
2008. As of March 31, 2003, we had $97.5 million, $184.9 million, and 
$231.1 million outstanding under our revolving credit facility, the tranche B 
term loan, and the tranche A term loan, respectively. As of March 31, 2003, the 
effective interest rate for our credit facility was 3.81%. We incurred this 
indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of our predecessor company, 
Citadel Communications, in June 2001.

(1)   Our existing senior term loan matures in December 2006 and, as of June 28, 
2003, bore interest at LIBOR plus 3.50%.  
   
(2)   Our senior subordinated notes mature on February 1, 2013. We intend to 
redeem 35% of the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the senior 
subordinated notes at a price of 110.75% of the principal amount being redeemed, 
plus accrued interest from August 1, 2003 through the date of redemption. The 
amount set forth in the table does not reflect accrued interest.  
   
(3)   As of June 28, 2003, our Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred 
Stock had accreted values (including accrued and unpaid dividends) of 
$250.2 million and $205.0 million, respectively. We intend to redeem all of our 
outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock. Additionally, 
we intend to redeem all outstanding options to purchase shares of our Series A 
Preferred Stock for approximately $2.3 million and all outstanding options to 
purchase shares of our Series B Preferred Stock for approximately $1.9 million.  
   
(4)   Includes cash that will be used to redeem the additional accretion of our 
Series A Preferred Stock and Series B Preferred Stock from June 28, 2003 
through September 26, 2003, the anticipated closing date of this offering. On 
September 26, 2003, the accreted value of our Series A Preferred Stock and 
Series B Preferred Stock including accrued and unpaid dividends would be $258.6 
million and $212.5 million, respectively. The amount set forth in the table 
does not reflect the payment of an aggregate of $8.5 million that we have 
agreed to make to Francisco Partners and CVC in connection with the amendment 
of our advisory agreements with them and the cessation of annual advisory fees 
payable to them by us under those agreements. Such payment will be made from 
existing cash reserves.  


      We intend to use $260.9 million of the net proceeds from this offering 
for the redemption in full of our Series A Preferred Stock as accreted through 
the anticipated completion date of this offering (including accrued and unpaid 
dividends) and options to purchase shares of Series A Preferred Stock and 
$214.4 million for the redemption in full of our Series B Preferred Stock as 
accreted through the anticipated completion date of this offering (including 
accrued and unpaid dividends) and options to purchase shares of Series B 
Preferred Stock. The following table shows the amounts that our affiliates will 
receive from the net proceeds of this offering for the redemption in full of 
our Series A Preferred Stock and options to purchase Series A Preferred Stock

common stock of approximately $231.9 million after deducting the underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses, or approximately $268.0 million if
the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. We will not
receive any proceeds from the sale of 396,000 shares of class A common stock by
the selling shareholder.

   We intend to use our net proceeds from this offering, plus up to an
additional $110.2 million in funds that we expect to obtain from our new $350
million debt facility, to fund the tender offer as described under ""The Share
Exchange and the Tender Offer.""

   We anticipate that the price offered in the tender offer will be at or above
the offering price of the class A shares in this offering. However, we will
determine the tender offer price, which may be at, above or below the market
price of the class A shares at the time of the tender offer.

   We anticipate that holders of class B common stock will be able to offer to
sell in the tender offer, without any fees or commissions, up to 33% and
possibly up to 50% of their class B shares. In this manner, tenders of up to
33% of a holder's class B shares will be accepted, and to the extent some
holders tender less than 33% of their class B shares, then this shortfall will
be allocated to the holders that have tendered more than the 33% amount (but no
more than 50%) on a pro rata basis.

   The final percentages will be set by our board of directors at the time the
tender offer is commenced. The board will take into consideration the amount of
net proceeds we receive in this offering, the availability of funds under our
new debt facility and the market price of the class A common stock. No final
decision will be made until the time the tender offer is commenced, and even
then, we could change the terms of the tender offer prior to its completion. We
cannot assure you that the tender offer will occur on these terms.

   In connection with our share exchange, the holders of Old Journal common
stock and beneficial interests in Old Journal common stock will be entitled to
exercise dissenters' rights. To the extent dissenters' rights are exercised, a
portion of the proceeds of this offering may be used to satisfy our resulting
obligations."

requirements for the next 18 months. We will need additional funding to 
complete the construction and qualification of a commercial scale manufacturing 
facility, to complete some of our clinical trials, including patient follow-up 
in our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial, and for the establishment of sales and 
marketing capabilities.

bearing obligations, investment grade instruments, certificates of deposit or 
direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States. The goal with respect to 
the investment of these net proceeds is capital preservation and liquidity so 
that such funds are readily available to fund our research and development

this offering will be approximately $6.24 million, based on an offering price 
of $5.00 per share, the offering price on the cover of this prospectus. The net 
proceeds are equal to the gross proceeds of $7.75 million after deducting 
underwriting discounts of $.77 million, non-accountable expense allowance of 
$.23 million and our estimated other offering expenses of $.51 million. We will 
receive approximately $7.27 million in net proceeds if the managing underwriter 
exercises its over-allotment option in full. 

      Currently, we intend to use the net proceeds as follows: 
Description                                       Amount             Net Proceeds  
--------------------------------------------      ----------------   ------------
Retire existing mortgage on production plant      $  3.6  million           58% 
Payment of slotting fees to obtain shelf space 
 in additional grocery stores, retail superstores 
 and club stores in new and existing markets      $  .81  million           13%
Marketing, advertising and costs of promotions 
 in conjunction with entering new markets         $  1.4  million           22%     
Working capital                                   $  .43  million            7%

      We have not allocated proceeds of this offering to payment of the 
10% annual dividend on the preferred stock we will issue to James E. Lewis and 
his wife when we acquire Stokes Ellis Foods. The preferred stock will accrue 
dividends at the rate of 10% per annum, payable in quarterly installments of 
$.25 million while the preferred stock is outstanding. We intend to use cash 
flow from operations to pay the dividends on the preferred stock. Although we 
believe operating cash flow will be more than adequate to pay such dividends, 
any shortfall will be paid from the senior revolving credit facility we intend 
to obtain at or immediately following this offering. 

      In July 2003, we received a commitment letter from a bank for a 
$5.0 million revolving credit facility. Subject to the $5.0 million cap, the 
commitment letter provides that we can borrow up to 70% of the appraised value 
of the production facility owned by Stokes Ellis Foods, 75% of eligible 
accounts receivable and 50% of finished goods inventory. If we obtain the 
revolving credit facility, we intend to use the proceeds for working capital 
and to pay off up to $1.7 million in loans received from our principal 
stockholder and nine individual lenders. Until we obtain a senior credit 
facility, we have agreed with the managing underwriter that we will not retire 
the mortgage on our production plant and that proceeds allocated for such 
purpose will be held by us in short-term highly rated securities. If we do not 
obtain a senior credit facility within 12 months of the date of this prospectus, 
we will reallocate proceeds to be used to pay off the mortgage to our 
continuing debt service obligations under the existing mortgage and to working 
capital. Our annual debt service obligations are approximately $416,000 under 
the existing mortgage. 

      If the managing underwriter exercises its over-allotment option in this 
offering, the additional net proceeds will be proportionately allocated for the 
uses described above, exclusive of additional funds being used to retire the 
existing mortgage on the production plant. 

      The existing mortgage on our production plant currently bears interest at 
8.5% per year and calls for monthly payments of approximately $35,000. The 
mortgage is collateralized by the land, building and equipment owned by us. As 
indicated above, we intend to retire the mortgage using proceeds of this 
offering once we obtain a senior credit facility. At June 30, 2003, the balance 
outstanding under the mortgage was approximately $3.6 million. 

      Pending application of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds in short-term highly rated securities."

approximately $94.0 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option 
to purchase additional shares. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale 
of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders. 

        We intend to contribute the net proceeds from this offering to our 
operating subsidiary, for use as follows: 

• approximately $68.0 million to redeem approximately $61.3 million in principal 
amount of the outstanding senior subordinated notes issued in connection with 
the Acquisition at a redemption price of 110.875% of the principal amount, plus 
redemption premiums of approximately $6.7 million, 


• approximately $5.5 million to prepay principal outstanding of the term loan 
under our senior credit facility, and 


• if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase additional 
shares, approximately $11.7 million to prepay indebtedness under our senior 
credit facility. 


        The senior credit facility, as amended, includes a $118.0 million term 
loan and a $75.0 million revolving loan facility. Amounts outstanding under the 
term loan are due on September 30, 2008 and accrue interest, at our option, at 
a rate per annum equal to either: 

• a base rate equal to the greater of the Fleet National Bank prime lending rate 
and the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 1/2 of 1%; or 


• a rate related to the Eurodollar rate, 

in each case, plus an applicable interest margin. The current applicable 
interest margin for the term loan ranges from 2.25% to 2.75% for Eurodollar 
rate loans and from 1.25% to 1.75% for base rate loans. As of July 5, 2003, the 
interest rate payable on our term loan borrowings was approximately 4.4% using 
an applicable interest margin of 3.25%. 

        Upon the completion of this offering, we will also pay Berkshire 
Partners LLC $2.6 million to terminate our future obligations under our 
management agreement with them. We intend to use any remaining net proceeds for 
general corporate purposes, such as funding working capital. Our outstanding senior 
subordinated notes bear interest at 10.875% and mature on August 15, 2011."

         Rainier Pacific Financial Group will retain 50% of the net conversion
proceeds and will purchase all of the capital stock of Rainier Pacific Bank to
be issued in the conversion in exchange for the remaining 50% of the net
conversion proceeds. Rainier Pacific Financial Group intends to use a portion of
the net proceeds to make a loan directly to the employee stock ownership plan to
enable it to purchase up to 8.0% of the aggregate shares of common stock (1)
sold in the offering and (2) contributed to the Rainier Pacific Foundation; or
if shares are not available, in the open market after the conversion. Based upon
the sale of 5,100,000 shares of common stock in the offering and the
contribution of 326,400 shares of common stock to the foundation, and the sale
of 6,900,000 shares of common stock in the offering and the contribution of
441,600 shares of common stock to the foundation, at the minimum and maximum of
the estimated offering range, respectively, the loan to the Rainier Pacific Bank
employee stock ownership plan would be $4.3 million and $5.9 million,
respectively. See ""Management - Benefits - Employee Stock Ownership Plan.""

         Rainier Pacific Financial Group will contribute to the Rainier Pacific
Foundation a combination of cash and stock equal to 8.0% of the gross proceeds
of the shares sold in the offering. Eighty percent of the total contribution
will be made in stock and 20% will be made in cash. In addition, Rainier Pacific
Financial Group intends to adopt a restricted stock plan, subject to shareholder
approval, and will use a portion of its proceeds to fund the purchase of shares
in the open market for the plan. The restricted stock plan intends to purchase
4.0% of the aggregate shares sold in the offering and contributed to the
foundation, or $2.2 million and $2.9 million at the minimum and maximum of the
estimated offering range, respectively.

         The remaining net proceeds retained by Rainier Pacific Financial Group
initially may be used to invest in U.S. Government and federal agency securities
of various maturities, mortgage-backed or other securities, deposits in either
Rainier Pacific Bank or other financial institutions, or a combination thereof.
The net proceeds may ultimately be used to:

         o        support the growth in Rainier Pacific Bank's core retail
                  business activities within its geographical market;

         o        provide funding for Rainier Pacific Bank's lending activities;

         o        expand small business banking services;

         o        support the future expansion of operations through the
                  establishment or acquisition of additional banking offices or
                  other customer facilities;

         o        acquire other financial service providers, although no such
                  acquisition transactions are specifically being considered at
                  this time;

         o        enhance Rainier Pacific Bank's technology and delivery
                  channels;

         o        repay Rainier Pacific Bank's borrowings in the ordinary course
                  of business;

         o        diversifying its activities as such opportunities become
                  available; or

         o        for general corporate purposes.

         We intend to utilize a portion of the net proceeds from the conversion
to expand our existing banking operations, including adding additional branch
locations. We are currently in the process of designing and obtaining permits
for our second branch in the City of Federal Way and will be seeking additional
locations in Pierce County in the future.

         The net proceeds from the conversion may also be used for other
business and investment purposes, including the payment of regular or special
cash dividends, possible repurchases of the common stock or returns of capital.


         Following the completion of the conversion, to the extent permitted by
the Washington Department of Financial Institutions and based upon then existing
facts and circumstances, Rainier Pacific Financial Group's board of directors
may determine to repurchase shares of common stock, subject to any applicable
statutory and regulatory requirements. Facts and circumstances which may lead us
to repurchase shares include but are not limited to:

         o        market and economic factors such as the price at which the
                  stock is trading in the market, the volume of trading, the
                  attractiveness of other investment alternatives in terms of
                  the rate of return and risk involved in the investment, the
                  ability to increase the book value and/or earnings per share
                  of the remaining outstanding shares, and an improvement in
                  Rainier Pacific Financial Group's return on equity;

         o        the avoidance of dilution to shareholders by not having to
                  issue additional shares to cover the exercise of stock options
                  or to fund employee stock benefit plans; and

         o        any other circumstances in which repurchases would be in the
                  best interests of Rainier Pacific Financial Group and its
                  shareholders.

         Any stock repurchases will be subject to the determination of our board
of directors that Rainier Pacific Bank will be capitalized in excess of all
applicable regulatory requirements after any such repurchases.

         The portion of the net proceeds used by Rainier Pacific Financial Group
to purchase the capital stock of Rainier Pacific Bank will be added to Rainier
Pacific Bank's general funds to be used for general corporate purposes,
including increased lending and investment activities. While the amount of net
proceeds received by Rainier Pacific Bank will further strengthen Rainier
Pacific Bank's capital position, its capital position already exceeds all
regulatory requirements. After the conversion, based upon the maximum of the
estimated offering range, Rainier Pacific Bank's tangible capital ratio will be
approximately 12.0%. As a result, Rainier Pacific Bank will continue to be a
well-capitalized institution.

         The net proceeds may vary because total expenses of the conversion may
be more or less than those estimated. The net proceeds will also vary if the
number of shares to be issued in the conversion is adjusted to reflect a change
in the estimated pro forma market value of Rainier Pacific Bank. Payments for
shares made through withdrawals from existing deposit accounts at Rainier
Pacific Bank will not result in the receipt of new funds for investment by
Rainier Pacific Bank but will result in a reduction of Rainier Pacific Bank's
interest expense and liabilities as funds are transferred from interest-bearing
certificates or other deposit accounts."

notes due 2010 for approximately $47.7 million, or 109% of the aggregate 
principal amount of the notes being redeemed; and 


• exercise our right of first refusal to purchase for $27.0 million all of the 
outstanding shares of the Class B Preferred Stock. 

        We expect to use additional proceeds from this offering of approximately 
$4.1 million for general corporate purposes, including working capital. 

        The foregoing amounts assume the sale of the 9% senior notes due 2010 
and the offering were completed on June 30, 2003. The actual amount required to 
redeem approximately $43.8 million in aggregate principal amount of the 9% 
senior notes due 2010 will be affected by the amount of interest accrued and 
unpaid from the date of issuance to the date of redemption. 

        Our indebtedness under the 9% senior notes due 2010 bears interest at 
an annual rate of 9%. We applied the net proceeds from the issuance of the 
9% senior notes due 2010 toward the repayment of the indebtedness under the 
subordinated bridge facility and the term loan portion of the senior secured 
credit facility. The 9% senior notes due 2010 mature July 15, 2010."

factors, including the progress of our research and development activities and 
clinical trials, the number and breadth of our product development programs, 
our ability to establish and maintain corporate collaborations and other 
arrangements and the amount of cash, if any, generated by our operations. In 
addition, a portion of the net proceeds may be used for the acquisition of 
businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to our own,

HNC Software Inc. This amount was subject to acceleration in the event that a 
client of HNC Software Inc. paid us $750,000 or any portion thereof. If the 
$750,000 or any portion thereof was not collected by us on or before April 30,

______________
(1) Estimated fees and expenses consist primarily of the tender premium to be 
paid to repurchase the senior subordinated notes, fees to be paid to the 
underwriters in connection with this offering and fees to be paid to the 
coordinators of our new senior credit facility. 

        In connection with our acquisition of the Allied and Pickfords 
businesses on November 19, 1999, our subsidiary, North American Van Lines, 
entered into a senior credit agreement providing for a revolving credit 
facility of up to $150.0 million in revolving credit commitments, our Tranche A 
term loan, a seven-year term loan of $150.0 million, and our Tranche B term 
loan, an eight-year term loan of $175.0 million. In connection with the 
purchase of CRS, North American Van Lines borrowed an additional $50.0 million 
under the Tranche B term loan facility. The loans under the revolving credit 
facility mature on the seventh anniversary of the initial borrowing. The term 
loans and loans under the revolving credit facility bear interest at specified 
margins over a base rate or a eurodollar rate, depending on the interest rate 
option we elect. As of September 30, 2003, the interest on the Tranche A loan 
was 3.87%, the interest rate on the Tranche B loan was 5.12% and the interest 
on the $82.0 million then outstanding under the revolving credit facility was 3.92%. 

        In connection with our acquisition of the Allied and Pickfords 
businesses on November 19, 1999, North American Van Lines issued $150.0 million 
aggregate principal amount of 13 3 / 8 % senior subordinated notes due 2009 
pursuant to an indenture. The senior subordinated notes mature in 2009. They 
bear interest at a rate of 13 3 / 8 % per annum. We have commenced a tender 
offer for all of the senior subordinated notes. As of November 24, 2003, 
approximately 93% of the notes have been tendered and we do not expect any 
additional notes to be tendered. 

        SIRVA's senior discount loan had an initial value of $35.0 million at 
November 19, 1999. The loan accretes at a rate of 16.0% per annum compounded 
semi-annually until December 1, 2004. Thereafter, the senior discount loan will 
bear interest at a rate of 16.0% per annum, payable semi-annually. As of 
September 30, 2003, our senior discount loan had accreted to $63.5 million. 
Such amount will be paid to the subsidiary of Clayton, Dubilier & Rice Fund VI 
Limited Partnership that purchased the senior discount loan on November 12, 
2002. This subsidiary will in turn use these proceeds to repay a loan from an 
affiliate of Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, one of the underwriters of this 
offering. 

        SIRVA's junior exchangeable preferred stock had an aggregate 
liquidation preference of $32.1 million as at September 30, 2003, which 
includes $7.6 million of accrued and unpaid dividends. It has a dividend rate 
of 12.4% compounded quarterly, although the payment of dividends is subject to 
the discretion of our Board of Directors. 

        In connection with the purchase of CRS, the relocation services 
business of Cooperative Resource Services, Ltd., our subsidiary, North American 
Van Lines, issued two seller notes in the principal amounts of $10.0 million 
and $5.0 million, maturing on May 3, 2007, and May 3, 2013, respectively. The 
notes have an interest rate of 10.0% per annum payable quarterly in arrears. 
50.0% of the interest rate is payable in kind and the remaining 50.0% is 
payable in cash. As of September 30, 2003, the notes had a principal amount of 
$10.7 million and $5.4 million, respectively."

underwriting discounts and other estimated expenses, will be approximately 
$50.9 million, or $59.0 million if the underwriters exercise their 
over-allotment option in full, in each case before considering $0.6 million of 
expenses that have already been incurred. 

  

We intend to use approximately $34.9 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering to pay the following existing indebtedness: 

  

   •     Revolving and Term Notes .    As of July 31, 2003, we had 
approximately $20.5 million in outstanding revolving debt and $13.5 million in 
outstanding term debt under our bank credit facility. The revolving notes 
mature on September 13, 2005 and provide for quarterly interest payments at a 
variable rate, which was 3.6% as of July 31, 2003. The term notes mature on 
September 13, 2005, and provide for aggregate quarterly payments of 
$1.5 million plus interest at a variable rate, which was 3.4% as of July 31, 
2003. We intend to pay the outstanding revolving debt in full and pay 
$5.0 million of the outstanding term debt.  

  

   •     Short-Term Notes .    As of July 31, 2003, we had approximately 
$1.8 million in outstanding notes payable to a bank and $3.5 million payable to 
an insurance company. These notes represent short-term borrowings under 
revolving agreements that bear interest as of July 31, 2003, at 3.5% 
(in the case of the bank debt, which is prime less 0.5%) and 7.5% (in the case 
of the insurance company debt, which is prime plus 1.0% with a floor of 7.5%). 
The bank debt matures in April 2004, and the insurance company debt matures in 
November 2003.  

  

   •     Promissory Notes Payable to Former Stockholders .    As of July 31, 
2003, we had approximately $4.0 million in outstanding notes payable to two 
former stockholders. One of the notes, with a balance of $3.4 million, is 
subordinated to our senior debt, bears interest at 9.0% and matures in July 
2005. The other note, with a balance of $0.6 million, is unsecured, bears 
interest at 6.0% and matures in January 2005.  

  

   •     Installment Obligations Payable to Financial Institutions .    As of 
July 31, 2003, we had approximately $0.1 million in outstanding notes payable 
to various financial institutions. These notes represent installment 
obligations that are due monthly and that had a weighted average interest rate 
of 4.1% as of July 31, 2003.  

  

We expect to use up to approximately $1.7 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering to redeem outstanding shares of our preferred stock immediately after 
the closing of this offering. 

  

We expect to use the remaining proceeds of approximately $14.9 million for 
general corporate purposes, including the continued growth and expansion of our 
business. 

  

The amount of funds we actually use for any particular purpose will depend on 
many factors, including changes in our business strategy, material changes in 
our revenues, expenses and cash flow, and other factors. For example, if our 
future revenues and cash flow are less than we currently anticipate, we may 
need to support our ongoing business operations with proceeds of this offering 
that we would otherwise use to support growth and expansion. Accordingly, 
except for the required repayment of the $5.0 million in outstanding term debt 
and the payment to effect the redemption of our preferred stock, our management 
will have significant discretion over the use and investment of the net 
proceeds of this offering and may spend such proceeds for any purpose, 
including purposes not presently contemplated. 

  

Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in interest-bearing accounts, short-term interest-bearing investment 
grade securities or both. 

  

We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling 
stockholder."

outstanding $37 million aggregate principal amount at maturity of 16% senior 
discount notes due 2009 of Nexstar Finance Holdings, L.L.C. and Nexstar Finance 
Holdings, Inc., collectively referred to herein as “Nexstar Finance Holdings”;

Quorum acquisition; and  

  

   •     $4.0 million will be used to pay Perry A. Sook, our chief executive

Prior to the redemption of Nexstar Finance Holdings’ 16% senior discount notes,

may deliver $34.5 million to the trustee for these notes to discharge them 
prior to the redemption date. 

  

For a discussion of the sources and uses of funds in connection with the Quorum 
acquisition, see “The Quorum Acquisition.” If the Quorum acquisition is not 
consummated, we will use the $31.4 million of the net proceeds of this offering 
for general corporate purposes. 

  

Our ability to use the proceeds from this offering to redeem the 16% senior 
discount notes may be, and our ability to use the proceeds from this offering 
to partially finance the Quorum acquisition is, conditioned upon our receipt of 
a waiver or amendment to our senior credit facilities allowing us to use the 
proceeds for these purposes. If we cannot obtain such a waiver or amendment to 
allow us to redeem the 16% senior discount notes, if required, or if the Quorum 
acquisition does not occur, we will use the proceeds from this offering that 
were intended for such purposes for general corporate purposes, including 
financing future acquisitions."

common stock that we are selling in this offering will be $117.4 million, at 
the initial public offering price of $17.00 per share, and after deducting the 
underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. If the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, we 
estimate that we will receive net proceeds of $135.2 million. 

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds of this offering, 
together with our cash on hand, for the following: 

–> approximately $40.6 million to redeem our Redeemable Class A preferred units,
which is equal to their original issuance price plus cumulative dividends that 
will have accrued through the date of this offering at a rate of 8% per annum, 
compounded quarterly, since September 2000 and are mandatorily redeemable as a 
result of this offering; 


–> approximately $25.0 million to repay indebtedness estimated to be outstanding 
through the date of this offering under our term and revolving credit 
facilities; 


–> approximately $14.1 million to pay out previously taxed but undistributed 
earnings to holders of units of LECG Holding Company, LLC; 


–> approximately $1.0 million to be distributed to holders of units of LECG 
Holding Company, LLC to cover these holders' current tax liabilities through 
the date of this offering; and 


–> the balance for our general corporate purposes, including working capital. 
Our indebtedness under our credit facility has two components, a term component 
and a revolver component. On March 31, 2003, we entered into an amended and 
restated credit agreement which increased our maximum borrowing limit from 
$23.8 million to $30.0 million and extended the maturity dates as follows: 

–> the revolver component increased from $5.0 million to $12.0 million and the 
maturity date was extended from June 30, 2003 to March 31, 2006; and 


–> the term loan component decreased from $18.8 million to $18.0 million and the 
maturity date was extended from June 30, 2005 to March 31, 2006. 
Accordingly, our total outstanding borrowings under this credit agreement 
increased from $20.3 million at December 31, 2002 to $27.3 million at September 
30, 2003. The additional net borrowings were $7.0 million during the period, of 
which $2.4 million was used to acquire the business and certain assets formerly 
owned by the Center for Forensic Economic Studies, and the balance of which was 
used for general corporate purposes, including working capital required by our 
continued growth. The term facility bears interest, at our option, of either, 
(1) LIBOR plus 3.25% or (2) the prime rate plus 1.25%. The revolver facility 
bears interest, at our option, of either, (1) LIBOR plus 3.0% or (2) the prime 
rate plus 1.0%. As of September 30, 2003, the applicable borrowing rate for the 
term loan was 4.25% and the borrowing rate for the revolving credit facility 
was 4.75%. In August 2003, we amended our credit agreement to increase the 
revolver portion of our credit facility by $6.0 million to a maximum borrowing 
limit of $18.0 million. 

We will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of this 
offering. Should we determine to employ cash resources for the acquisition of 
complementary businesses, products or technologies, the amounts available for 
the purposes cited above may be significantly reduced. Although we evaluate 
potential acquisitions in the ordinary course of business, we have no specific 
understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisition or 
investment at this time. 

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering for the above purposes, we 
intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a 
favorable return."

The principal purposes of this offering are (i) to create a public market for 
our common stock for the benefit of all shareholders, (ii) to attract and 
retain qualified employees by providing them with equity incentives, and 
(iii) to ensure that we are capable of defending our intellectual property 
rights. We believe that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated 
growth, our cash from operations, together with cash currently available, 
without giving effect to the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient 
to fund our operations for the foreseeable future. 

  

We may use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, 
including the following: 

  

   •     working capital;  

  

   •     litigation expenses incurred to defend our intellectual property 
rights;  

  

   •     other general and administrative expenses;  

  

   •     acquisitions of complementary technologies or businesses, although we

   •     capital expenditures;  

  

   •     sales and marketing expenses;  

  

   •     research and development expenses; and

1,478,745 shares if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive from the offering for the 
following purposes:

interest for the current quarterly period, which has a fixed interest rate of 
11.0% per annum and is scheduled to mature on March 30, 2006;  
   
   •  to pay approximately $6.0 million of accrued dividends owed on our 
preferred stock, which accrued at a rate of 7.0% per annum from their 
respective issue dates through July 24, 2001, and at 8.0% per annum thereafter; and  
   
   •  for general corporate and working capital purposes, including but not 
limited to investing in lease originations, establishing regional offices in 
strategic locations and hiring additional sales account executives.  


The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures for each purpose may vary 
significantly depending upon numerous factors, including our volume of lease 
originations, payments received on existing leases, availability of funding 
from external sources and the amount of cash, if any, we generate from 
operations. 

We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the net proceeds we 
receive from this offering for other purposes, and we will have broad 
discretion in applying the net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses 
described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of this offering in

offering of the new notes, we and Quality Distribution, LLC intend to mail 
irrevocable notices of redemption to holders of the securities to be redeemed 
as part of the Transaction. We and Quality Distribution, LLC currently expect 
to redeem the securities within 60 days after the mailing of such notices. On

offering will be approximately $76.7 million at an initial public offering

commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us. If the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full, we estimate that our net proceeds 
will be approximately $88.4 million. 

      The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, 
establish a public market for our common stock and to facilitate our future 
access to the public capital markets. We anticipate that we will use the net 
proceeds of this offering to further develop and commercialize our existing 
product portfolio, including the planned expenditure of $20.0 million over the 
next four years to fund clinical studies in connection with the development of 
Thalidomide Pharmion 50mg and Vidaza. We will also use the net proceeds of this 
offering to fund $10.0 million of product licensing payments due through 2005, 
to expand our sales and marketing organization, to acquire or in-license 
additional late-stage or approved products, and for general corporate purposes. 
We have no present understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to 
any acquisitions, investments or joint ventures. 

      Accordingly, our management will have broad discretion in applying the 
net proceeds of this offering. Pending these uses, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds of this offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment grade 
securities, certificates of deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the 
U.S. government."

common stock will be approximately $60.2 million, or approximately 
$69.4 million if the underwriters fully exercise their overallotment option, in 
each case at an initial public offering price of $11.00 per share and after 
deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We expect to use the net proceeds to fund: 

• establishment of sales and marketing capabilities, as well as manufacturing 
and distribution arrangements required to launch our lead drug candidate, BiDil, 
pending FDA approval; 


• preclinical and clinical development of existing product candidates; 


• discovery and development of additional product candidates; and 


• working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate purposes. 

       The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon 
numerous factors, including the timing of the completion of our phase III 
confirmatory trial of BiDil, the timing of BiDil regulatory submissions, any 
terms or conditions imposed as a condition of any approval of BiDil, the 
progress of our commercialization efforts for BiDil, the amount of competitive 
sales and marketing activities we may face within the heart failure market, the 
amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering and the amount of cash 
generated by our operations. 

       We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, companies, technologies, products or assets that complement our 
business. However, we have no present understandings, commitments or agreements 
to enter into any potential acquisitions or investments. Further, we have not 
determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the areas listed above or the 
timing of these expenditures. As a result, our management will have broad 
discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering. Pending utilization 
of the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds of 
the offering in short-term investment grade and U.S. government securities."

offering will be approximately $17,600,000 ($20,240,000 if the underwriter’s 
over-allotment option is exercised), after deducting estimated underwriting 
discounts and other offering expenses. 

      We intend to use (a) up to $600,000 of these net proceeds to repay the 
amounts outstanding on our line of credit, (b) $770,125 for payments to our 
Series A Preferred Stockholders pursuant to the Securities Conversion Agreement 
in consideration for the conversion of their holdings into our common shares, 
and (c) the remaining proceeds for general corporate purposes, including 
(1) providing capital to Coast Bank to support its growth and additional branch 
locations and to expand Coast Bank’s loan and investment portfolio, (2) the 
acquisition of other financially related businesses or banks, and (3) funding 
our working capital requirements. 

      Under the line of credit to be repaid from the proceeds of this offering, 
the Company may borrow up to $600,000 at an annual interest rate equal to the 
prime rate. This credit facility matures on April 15, 2005. As of the date of 
this prospectus, we have been advanced approximately $403,000 under this line 
of credit. However, we anticipate that the full amount of the line of credit 
will be advanced prior to closing. These funds were used for general working 
capital expenses, including the payment of expenses incurred in connection with 
the organization of Coast Financial Holdings, and its formation as a bank 
holding company, and to fund a dividend payment to the holders of our Series A 
Preferred Shares for the second quarter of 2003. The credit facility will be 
repaid and terminated on the date this offering closes. 

      Pursuant to a Securities Conversion Agreement dated October 20, 2003, by 
and between the Company and each of our Series A Preferred Stockholders, we 
have agreed to pay an aggregate of $770,125 in exchange for the conversion of 
all outstanding Series A Preferred Stock into our common shares at the closing 
of this offering. 

      At the current time, we do not have agreements or understanding nor are 
we engaged in negotiations to make any acquisitions, but we are continually 
evaluating opportunities to do so.

needed for general corporate purposes."

The net proceeds received from the sale of shares of KNBT Bancorp common stock 
in the conversion offering will increase the capital of both KNBT Bancorp and 
Keystone. Half of the net proceeds from the conversion offering will be used 
by KNBT Bancorp to buy the common stock of Keystone upon its conversion from 
mutual to stock form. Keystone will use the portion of the cash proceeds it 
receives for general corporate purposes. The net proceeds received by Keystone 
will strengthen its capital position, which already exceeds all regulatory 
requirements, and will provide it with additional flexibility to grow and 
diversify in the future. The proceeds invested in Keystone may also be 
used to fund new loan growth and additional investments in investment 
securities and for other general corporate uses in furtherance of Keystone’s 
post-merger business strategy. The net proceeds received by Keystone may 
ultimately be used to finance the expansion of banking operations through 
acquisitions of other financial institutions or additional branch offices, 
although no such transactions are specifically being considered at this time 
other than the proposed merger with First Colonial. 

  

A portion of the net proceeds from the conversion offering retained by 
KNBT Bancorp will be used to make a loan to its employee stock ownership 
plan in an amount sufficient to permit it to buy up to 8.0% of the shares 
sold in the conversion offering. The remaining portion of the net proceeds 
after the loan to the employee stock ownership plan and the purchase of 
Keystone’s common stock will be retained by KNBT Bancorp and will be available 
for general corporate purposes. KNBT Bancorp may initially use the remaining 
net proceeds to invest in deposits at Keystone, U.S. Government and federal 
agency securities of various maturities, federal funds, mortgage-backed 
securities, or a combination thereof. In addition, assuming shareholder 
approval of its proposed recognition and retention plan in the period 
between six months and one year after the conversion is completed, 
KNBT Bancorp intends to contribute sufficient funds to the stock 
recognition and retention plan so that it can purchase a number of 
shares equal to an aggregate of 4% of the common stock sold in the 
conversion offering. The net proceeds retained by KNBT Bancorp may 
ultimately be used to: 

  

   •     support the operations of Keystone after its merger with Nazareth 
National Bank;  

  

   •     support possible additional future expansion of Keystone, including the 
establishment of new branch offices or other facilities;  

  

   •     invest in deposits at Keystone or securities; or  

  

   •     fund repurchases of KNBT Bancorp’s common stock or serve as a source 
of possible payments of cash dividends."

discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses, or $36.1 million if

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, and to facilitate our future 
access to the public equity markets. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering for: 

• expansion of sales and marketing (approximately $5 million to $15 million); 

• continued development of existing products (approximately $2 million to $3 
million); 

• new product development (approximately $2 million to $4 million); and 

• working capital and other general corporate purposes, including potential 
acquisitions of products, technologies or companies (approximately $5 million 
to $9 million). 

We have no commitments with respect to any acquisition. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including the status of our product development efforts, sales and 
marketing activities, technological advances, competition and amount of cash 
generated or used by our operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to 
use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in 
the application of the balance of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described 
herein, we will invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest bearing, 
investment grade securities.

expected interest income and funds from operations, should be sufficient to 
finance our capital requirements for at least the next 12 months."

portfolio of mortgage-related assets, primarily U.S. agency and other 
highly-rated, single-family, adjustable-rate, hybrid adjustable-rate and 
fixed-rate mortgage-backed securities. We expect to pay market rates for 
brokerage fees and commissions when purchasing the securities. Until such assets 
can be identified and obtained, we intend to temporarily invest the balance of 
the proceeds of this offering in readily marketable interest-bearing assets 
consistent with our intention to qualify as a REIT.

receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering to repay a portion of our 
outstanding indebtedness. 

Our amended senior credit facilities consist of term loan A facilities, a term 
loan B facility and revolving credit facilities. The revolving credit facilities 
and the term loan A facilities will mature in 2008, and the term loan B facility 
will mature in 2009. Borrowings under our amended senior credit facilities bear 
interest, at the option of the borrower subsidiaries, at either a base rate, 
plus an applicable margin for the term loan facilities and revolving credit 
facilities, respectively, or a Eurodollar rate on deposits for one, two, three 
or six-month periods, plus an applicable margin for the term loan facilities and 
revolving credit facilities, respectively. Borrowings under our amended senior 
credit facilities as of September 30, 2003 had a blended annual interest rate 
of 4.65%. Our senior subordinated notes bear interest at an annual rate of 
10.25% and mature on August 15, 2010. Borrowings under the amended senior credit 
facilities and the net proceeds from the senior subordinated notes were used to 
fund the recapitalization in August 2003, refinance amounts borrowed to fund the 
acquisition of Tempur in 2002 and for working capital purposes. 

The foregoing use of the net proceeds from this offering represents our current 
intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. We retain broad 
discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds of this offering, and 
a change in our plans or business condition could result in the application of 
the net proceeds from this offering in a manner other than as described in this 
prospectus. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds from this offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities."

common stock that we are offering will be approximately $48.0 million based on 
the public offering price of $9.00 per share and after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the underwriters’ 
over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that we will receive 
net proceeds of approximately $7.5 million from the sale of an additional 
900,000 shares. 

We expect to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our 
remaining cash, to pay approximately $17.0 million to fund the Verizon Media 
acquisition, including the repayment of a $6.7 million promissory note, plus 
accrued interest, used to fund the acquisition of the cable system in Cerritos, 
California and related expenses, unless the lender exercises his option to 
convert such amounts into shares of common stock or non-voting common stock at 
the per share public offering price in this offering. Amounts outstanding under 
the promissory note bear interest at a rate of 12.0% per annum and mature upon 
the earlier of the tenth day following the completion of this offering and 
March 31, 2004. We will also use approximately $31.0 million to fund capital 
expenditures and operations in the Pinellas County, Florida market acquired from 
Verizon Media. We expect to use any remainder for general corporate purposes. 
Pending such uses, the net proceeds will be invested in interest-bearing, 
investment-grade, short-term investments. 

The amounts that we actually expend for these specified purposes may vary 
significantly depending on a number of factors, including changes in our 
business strategy, the amount of our future revenues and expenses, and our 
future cash flow. For example, if our future revenues or cash flow are less 
than we currently anticipate, we may need to support our ongoing business 
operations with proceeds of this offering that we would otherwise use to 
support growth and expansion or, if the acquisition of the Verizon Media cable 
system in Pinellas County, Florida is not consummated, we may choose to utilize 
a portion of the net proceeds intended for that acquisition to repay or retire 
other debt. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of 
the net proceeds of this offering and may spend such proceeds for any purpose, 
including purposes not presently contemplated."

common stock, to facilitate our future access to the public equity markets, and 
to obtain additional capital. We intend to use the net proceeds from this 
offering for: 

  

   •     sales and marketing activities: 20%;  

  

   •     promotion of existing and future product categories: 30%; and  

  

   •     general corporate purposes: 50%.  

  

In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use 
complementary technologies. We have no commitments with respect to any 
acquisition or investment. 

  

The amounts actually expended for each of the purposes listed above and the 
timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including 
the status of our efforts to increase our number of relationships with other 
retailers to use our market platform, sales and marketing activities, 
technological advances, amount of cash generated or used by our operations and 
competition. We have not determined the amount or timing of expenditures in the 
areas listed above and will retain broad discretion in the allocation and use 
of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the 
net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. We 
believe that our available cash, together with the net proceeds of this 
offering, will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the 
next 12 months."

offering to Mercer Mutual. In exchange, the Holding Company will receive all of
the authorized capital stock of Mercer Mutual.
 
     On a short-term basis, the remaining net proceeds will be invested
primarily in U.S. government securities and other federal agency securities.
These net proceeds will be available for a variety of corporate
purposes, including additional capital contributions to our insurance
subsidiaries and future acquisitions. We also may use a portion of these net
proceeds to fund the purchase by us in the open market of some or all of the
shares that would be used to make restricted stock awards or issued upon the
exercise of stock options, under our proposed stock-based incentive plan, if we
receive the prior approval of the Pennsylvania Insurance Department to purchase
these shares.
 
     The proceeds contributed to Mercer Mutual will become part of Mercer
Mutual's capital, and will help Mercer Mutual expand its underwriting capacity,
diversify its business and reduce its reliance on reinsurance. Mercer Mutual may
contribute a portion of these funds to its subsidiaries if necessary to support
their operations.
 
     Except for the foregoing, we currently have no specific plans, intentions,
arrangements or understandings regarding the proceeds of the offering."

officers and directors; however, Thomas Herskovits, our Chairman, and 
Andrew S. Wyant, our CEO are owed approximately $46,000 and $27,000, 
respectively, for unreimbursed business expenses, and Andrew S. Wyant and 
Frederic M. Schweiger, our CFO, are each entitled to a $50,000 bonus payment 
upon completion of this offering, which amounts will be paid out of the net 
proceeds of this offering and have been included in our accounts payable and 
accrued expenses that are past due or will become due at closing. The bank loan, 
which will also be paid out of the net proceeds of this offering, is personally 
guaranteed by Thomas Herskovits. Thomas Herskovits will receive payment of his 3
$250,000 of advances and $100,000 of secured convertible debentures out of the 
net proceeds of this offering. 

The allocation of the net proceeds from this offering set forth above represents 
our best estimate based upon our currently proposed plans and assumptions 
relating to our operations and certain assumptions regarding the success of our 
marketing programs and general economic conditions. If any of these factors 
change, or if we receive less than the anticipated net proceeds of this offering, 
we may find it necessary or advisable to reallocate some of the proceeds within 
the above-described categories or to use portions for other purposes. 

We anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering, together with projected 
cash flows from our operations, will be sufficient to fund our operations and 
capital requirements through November 30, 2004. However, if our marketing 
programs are not successful or we are unable to acquire new customers in a 
cost-effective manner, we may need to raise additional funds. Further, we 
cannot assure you that such funds will not be expended earlier due to 
unanticipated changes in economic conditions or other circumstances that we 
cannot foresee. In the event our plans change or our assumptions change or 
prove to be inaccurate, we could be required to seek additional financing sooner 
than currently anticipated. 

Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from this offering in 
government securities and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing 
instruments."

or $175.7 million if the underwriters’ overallotment option is exercised in 
full, after deducting the underwriting discounts and estimated offering 
expenses that we will pay. 

      We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering to originate and 
acquire interests in student loans potentially including up to approximately 
$55 million to fund a portion of the acquisitions to repay any revolving credit 
indebtedness outstanding at the closing of this offering and for general 
corporate purposes, including capital expenditures, working capital and 
possible acquisitions complementary to our business. The indebtedness to be 
repaid is revolving credit indebtedness with a weighted average interest rate 
of 1.40% as of October 31, 2003, and that matures on September 24, 2004. The 
proceeds of the indebtedness to be repaid were used to refinance one of our 
operating lines of credit. The borrowings under that line of credit were used 
to finance our 2001 acquisition of EFS, Inc., an Indiana student loan servicing 
and secondary market company. We do not expect revolving credit indebtedness to 
be repaid with the net proceeds of this offering to exceed approximately 
$26 million, which was the amount of such indebtedness outstanding on December 
10, 2003. Except as described in “Prospectus Summary — Potential Acquisitions,” 
we currently have no agreements or understandings with respect to any material 
acquisition. 

      A portion of the net proceeds from this offering may be applied to 
capital expenditures, which could include costs incurred in connection with 
expanding our sales and marketing forces. Such expansion may include up to the 
addition, between August 2003 and the end of the first quarter of 2004, of 
approximately 10 additional personnel, who market to schools and are dispersed 
throughout the country. During the same time period, we may also use a portion 
of the net proceeds from this offering to add up to approximately 100 direct 
consumer marketing personnel in Denver, Colorado, 70 in Lincoln, Nebraska and 
30 in Fredericksburg, Virginia. 

      The foregoing uses of the net proceeds from this offering represent our 
current intentions based upon our present plans and business condition. We 
retain broad discretion in the allocation and use of the net proceeds of this 
offering and a change in our plans or business condition could result in the 
application of the net proceeds from this offering in a manner other than as 
described in this prospectus. Pending the uses described above, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds from this offering in our student loan portfolio and/or 
short-term, investment grade securities."

July 29, 2006. It is guaranteed by Francisco Partners, the principal beneficial 
holder of our common stock. The loan was used by us to finance in part our 
acquisition of NPTest, Inc. from Schlumberger. We intend to use $20.75 million 
of our net proceeds for the redemption of a portion of the mandatory redeemable 
Series A Preferred Stock issued by our subsidiary, NPTest Capital Corporation, 
all of which is held by NPTest Holding, LLC, which is principally owned by 
Francisco Partners (95.7%) and Shah Management (3.6%). In addition, 
$5.0 million of our net proceeds will be used to make a one-time payment to 
Francisco Partners in consideration for the termination of certain obligations 
to Francisco Partners. The remainder of our net proceeds from this offering will 
be used for working capital and general corporate purposes, including the 
further development, production and commercialization of the Sapphire NP 
platform, and investments in selling, general and administrative activities and 
other product development. In addition, while we currently have no specific 
acquisition plans, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
complementary products, technologies or businesses.

common stock we are offering will be approximately $5.08 million, or 
approximately $5.96 million if the underwriter's over-allotment option is 
exercised in full, assuming an initial public offering price of $5.00 per share 
and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated offering expenses. Based on an initial public offering price of 
$5.00 per share, the gross proceeds from the sale of Class A common stock we 
are offering will be $6.5 million. If the underwriter's over-allotment option 
is exercised in full, the gross proceeds from the offering will be $7.5 million. 
Underwriting discounts and commissions will be $650,000, or $747,500 if the 
underwriter's over-allotment option is exercised in full. We estimate the 
offering expenses to be approximately $770,000. 

        We anticipate using the net proceeds from the sale of our Class A 
common stock offered hereby as follows: 

• 
to fund our continued development, commercialization and sale of our products 
and product candidates, which we estimate will require approximately 
$1.1 million (21.7% of net proceeds); 


• 
to implement our strategic marketing and commercialization plan, which we 
estimate will require approximately $1.5 million (29.5% of net proceeds), of 
which approximately $1.2 million is allocated to fund our radio advertising 
campaign; 


• 
to recruit and hire individuals for key senior management positions, which we 
estimate will require approximately $200,000 (3.9% of net proceeds); 


• 
to cover the cost of providing sales incentives, products samples and discounts, 
which we estimate will require approximately $350,000 (6.9% of net proceeds); 


• 
to repay, without interest, BioChemics approximately $99,000 (1.9% of net 
proceeds) for management fees charged back to us since we became a stand-alone 
entity upon our incorporation for centralized accounting, data processing, 
utilities, office space rental, supplies, telephone and other BioChemics 
corporate services and infrastructure costs, and approximately $347,000 
(6.8% of net proceeds) for other operational charges paid by BioChemics to 
third parties on our behalf since that time; and 


• to provide working capital and for general corporate purposes, which we 
estimate will require approximately $1.46 million (28.7% of net proceeds). 

        We anticipate, based on our current plans and assumptions relating to 
our operations, that the net proceeds of this offering, together with net cash 
from operations, should be sufficient to satisfy our cash requirements for at 
least twelve months after the date of this prospectus. 

        Although we have no current plans, agreements or commitments with 
respect to any acquisition, we may, if the opportunity arises, use an 
unspecified portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in products, 
technologies or companies.

we intend to invest the funds in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing 
securities. We cannot predict whether the proceeds invested will yield a 
favorable return."

US$18.0 per ADS. We will not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of ADSs 
by the selling shareholders. 

          The principal purposes of this offering are to (i) create a public 
market for our ordinary shares for the benefits of all shareholders, 
(ii) retain talented employees by providing them with equity incentives, and 
(iii) facilitate possible acquisitions of complementary businesses. We believe 
that, based on current levels of operations and anticipated growth, our cash 
from operations, together with cash currently available, without giving effect 
to the net proceeds of this offering, will be sufficient to fund our operations 
for the foreseeable future.

   •  approximately US$3.0 million to fund working capital;

technology upgrades;  
   
   •  approximately US$5.0 million to expand our sales and marketing efforts; and  
   
   •  the balance for general corporate purposes, including funding possible 
acquisitions of complementary businesses, such as travel consolidators and 
travel agencies in Greater China, particularly in China, although we are not 
currently negotiating any such transactions.

the particular uses for the net proceeds we will receive upon the completion of 
this offering. Accordingly, our management will have significant flexibility in
