approximately $33.9 million. If the underwriters fully exercise the over-
allotment option, the net proceeds to us will be approximately $39.3 million. 
""Net proceeds"" is what we expect to receive after paying the underwriting 
discount and expenses of the offering. The principal purposes of this offering 
are to increase our working capital, to create a public market for our shares, 
to facilitate future access to public capital markets and to increase our 
visibility in the marketplace. 

We intend to use a portion of the proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- completion of our new facility, estimated to cost a total of $4.0 million; 
and 

- repayment of indebtedness which as of March 31, 2000 was $0.9 million owed to 
PCB Ltd. and $9.0 million owed to Bank Leumi under credit facilities. 

Prior to July 1, 2000, the PCB loan was linked to the Israeli consumer price 
index and bore interest at a fixed rate of 2% per year. As of July 1, 2000, the 
PCB loan is linked to the U.S. dollar and bears interest at a fixed rate of 
6.5% per year. This loan matures upon the earlier of completion of this 
offering or December 31, 2000. The Bank Leumi credit facilities bear interest 
at various rates. The Bank Leumi credit facilities bear interest as follows: 
(1) loans in NIS bear interest at rates ranging from Israeli prime rate minus 
0.5% to Israeli prime rate plus 1% per year; (2) loans in Euros bear interest 
at the rate of 
5.5% per year; and (3) loans in U.S. dollars bear interest at the rate of 8% 
per year. These credit facilities are extendible on a monthly basis, with 
respect to loans in NIS, and on a quarterly basis, with respect to foreign 
currency loans. 

We currently intend to use the remaining net proceeds over time: 

- to fund our sales and marketing activities; 

- to invest in research and development activities; and 

- for other general corporate purposes. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we have not made any specific expenditure 
plans with respect to these remaining net proceeds. Therefore, we cannot 
specify with certainty the particular uses for the net proceeds to be received 
upon completion of this offering. Accordingly, our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. 

We believe that opportunities exist for the possible acquisition of additional 
businesses and technologies or the establishment of joint ventures that are 
complementary to our current or future business. Currently, we have no specific 
plans or commitments with respect to any acquisitions or joint ventures. We 
cannot be certain that we will complete any acquisition or joint venture or 
that, if completed, any acquisition or joint venture will be successful. 

Until we use the net proceeds of the offering, we will invest the funds in 
interest-bearing investments with interest and principal linked to the dollar, 
hedged to the dollar or linked to the Israeli consumer price index, or deposit 
the funds in dollar-linked or dollar-hedged bank accounts in Israel, Europe or 
the United States."

public capital markets. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering and the concurrent private 
placement for additional working capital and other general corporate purposes, 
including the funding of operating losses, the expansion of sales and marketing 
and product research and development activities. The amounts that we actually 
expend for working capital and other general corporate purposes will vary 
significantly depending on a number of factors, including future revenue 
growth, if any, and the amount of cash that we generate from operations. As a 
result, we will retain broad discretion over the allocation of the net proceeds 
from this offering. A portion of the net proceeds may also be used for the 
acquisition of businesses, products and technologies that are complementary to 
ours. Complementary businesses may include optical system manufacturers and 
companies with intellectual property portfolios relating to optical and 
networking technology. Other than as described in this prospectus, we have no 
current plans, agreements or commitments for acquisitions of any businesses, 
products or technologies. Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital, drug candidate discovery, development and

for the liquidation of a term-loan agreement with Comdisco, a preferred 
stockholder, during the remaining term of the agreement, which expires in 2001. 
Total remaining payments under this agreement as of June 30, 2000, including 
principal and interest at an effective annual rate of 17%, were approximately

are what we expect to receive after paying the underwriters' discounts and 
other expenses of this offering, based upon the initial public offering price 
of $19.00 per share. 

We currently plan to use the net proceeds of this offering for: 

- expansion and enhancement of our AMEsystem technology -- $9,750,000 

- internal development projects, including developing improved versions of 
currently marketed, FDA-approved biopharmaceuticals -- $26,000,000 

- additional research and development -- $3,250,000 

The balance of the proceeds, $41,965,500, will be used for general corporate 
purposes. 


The timing and amount of our actual expenditures are subject to: 

- the success of our research and development efforts 

- our ability to establish collaborative agreements 

- our costs of prosecuting and maintaining patents 

- market and competing technological developments

commissions, stamp duty reserve tax and our estimated net offering expenses, 
will be approximately $75.2 million ($86.7 million if the underwriters exercise 
their over-allotment option in full). 

We expect to use the net proceeds from the offering for working capital and 
other general corporate expenses, which may include: 

- funding our research and development program (which we estimate will account 
for between 30% and 50% of the net proceeds); 

- entering into new clinical collaborations (which we estimate will account for 
between 10% and 30% of the net proceeds); 

- expanding our sales and marketing efforts to license our gene discoveries 
(which we estimate will account for between 5% and 20% of the net proceeds); 
and 

- funding acquisitions, investments and partnerships. 

While we regularly evaluate investment, acquisition and partnership candidates, 
we have no present agreements or commitments for any investments, acquisitions 
or partnerships, and therefore none of the proceeds are specifically allocated 
for these purposes. We anticipate that our planned capital expenditures will be 
covered by the remaining undrawn amount of $3.0 million from a $5.0 million 
line of credit we have secured. We have not designated any of the proceeds of 
the offering for any specific purpose and expect to use those proceeds for 
working capital and general corporate expenses, including those purposes 
described above, as we require. Accordingly, you should be aware that we will 
have a significant amount of flexibility for the application of the net 
proceeds which we receive from this offering. 

Pending use of the net proceeds for these purposes, we intend to invest our net 
proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments. To 
determine whether we are a passive foreign investment company, the obligations 
will be considered ""passive assets"" and the interest we receive on them will be 
considered ""passive income."""

initial offering price of $8.00 per share, in net proceeds from this offering,

in full, we estimate that we will receive approximately $58.7 million in net 
proceeds from this offering, after deducting the estimated underwriting 
discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us. 

The principal reason for this offering is to raise funds for working capital 
and other general corporate purposes. We have not identified specific uses for 
the net proceeds from this offering. We generally intend to use the proceeds of 
this offering to: 

. expand our sales force and marketing activities; 

. further develop our services and systems; 

. increase our operational capacity; 

. finance potential acquisitions, joint ventures or investments in 
complementary businesses or technologies; and 

. fund other general corporate purposes. 

The amounts we actually expend in such areas may vary significantly and will 
depend on a number of contingencies. Among the factors relevant to the use of 
the net proceeds from this offering are the following: 

. our ability to attract and retain qualified employees; 

. the cost of additional research and development; 

. the cost of overhead related to our anticipated growth; and 

. our ability to identify and enter into strategic acquisition, investment and 
joint venture opportunities. 

Accordingly, management will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering. To the extent we do not use proceeds from this 
offering for one of the purposes outlined above, we anticipate that we will 
allocate such funds to one of the other purposes outlined above. You will not 
have the opportunity to evaluate the economic, financial or other information 
on which we base our decisions on how to use the proceeds. Investments we make 
with the net proceeds may not yield favorable returns and our accumulated 
deficit may increase. We have no current agreements or commitments with respect 
to any acquisitions, joint ventures or investments. Pending such uses, the 
estimated net proceeds of this offering will be invested in short term, 
interest bearing, investment grade securities."

underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses. If the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that our 
net proceeds will be approximately $158.5 million. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, together with our cash on 
hand, to fund expansion of our operations over the next 12 months as follows 
and other general corporate purposes: 

. $30 to $35 million to fund increased expenses related to additional personnel 
in our consulting services, technical support and training organizations; 

. $50 to $55 million to fund increased sales and marketing expenses related to 
the expansion of our direct sales force and an increase in marketing personnel

associated with the hiring of additional development personnel; and 

. $12 to $16 million to fund increased general and administrative expenses 
related to the enhancement of our infrastructure to support our growth. 

In addition, we anticipate capital expenditures for computer equipment and 
office furniture of approximately $10 million over the next 12 months and that 
we will repay existing indebtedness of $600,000. 

The amounts and timing of these expenditures and cash inflows will vary 
depending on a number of factors, including the amount of cash generated from 
operations, competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, 
if any, of our business. We may use a portion of the net proceeds to invest in 
or acquire additional businesses, products and technologies, or to establish 
joint ventures that we believe will complement our current and future business. 
Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds of this offering in short- 
term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

million if the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

The size of the offering has been determined primarily based upon our desire to 
raise a sufficient amount of capital to afford to us significant business 
flexibility in the future. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to: 

- create a public market for our common stock; 

- facilitate future access by us to public equity markets; and 

- enhance our ability to use our stock to make future acquisitions due to the 
fact that our shares will be publicly traded. 

We intend to use a portion of the net proceeds of this offering to repay in 
part outstanding indebtedness to Comdisco of approximately $3.9 million under a 
loan and security agreement and approximately $7.1 million under various 
capital leases and other debt. Indebtedness under the loan and security 
agreement has been accruing interest at a fixed rate of 11.5% and matures 
through 2003, and indebtedness under the capital leases accrue interest at 
rates ranging from 7.5% to 11.5% and mature at various dates through 2003. We 
expect to use the remainder of the net proceeds for working capital and general 
corporate purposes, including increased spending on sales and marketing, 
operations, professional services, research and development, expansion of our 
operational and administrative infrastructure and the leasing of additional 
facilities. In addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or 
invest in complementary businesses, technologies, product lines or products. We 
expect that our current cash balances and existing debt arrangements, together 
with the proceeds from this offering, will be sufficient to meet our cash 
requirements for the next twelve months. 

Based on our current business model, we expect that over the next twelve to 
eighteen months we will spend approximately 20% of the net proceeds of this 
offering to fund losses related to providing applications management services, 
40% on sales and marketing, 15% on research and development and 25% on general 
and administrative costs. These figures are subject to change, however, 
depending upon our rate of revenue growth, overall financial performance and 
evolving business needs. Additionally, these expectations may prove to be 
inaccurate, as our financial performance may differ from our current 
expectations or our business needs may change as our business model and the 
industry we address evolve. As a result, the proceeds we receive from this 
offering may be used in a manner significantly different from our current 
allocation plans. Therefore, we will have broad discretion in the way we use 
the net proceeds. 

Pending use, we intend to invest the net proceeds in short-term, interest-
bearing, investment grade securities, certificates of deposit or direct or

working capital and other general corporate purposes, including in management's 
estimation continued investment in research and development of between $15 
million and $25 million and sales and marketing expenditures of between $10

associated companies (including companies in the Seattle area under our 
Alliance Agreement with Microsoft), to provide additional funding to

The amount and timing of these expenditures will depend upon various factors, 
such as developments in our markets or those of our associated companies and 
the availability of acquisition and entrepreneurial opportunities. 
  
           The previous paragraphs describe our current estimates of our use of 
the net proceeds of this offering based on our current plans and estimates of 
anticipated expenses. Our actual expenditures may vary from these estimates. We 
may also find it necessary or advisable to reallocate the net proceeds within

infrastructure accounting for approximately $15.5 million. In addition, we 
intend to use approximately $36.0 million for sales and marketing activities.

- for general corporate purposes, including funding our capital expenditure 
program, our working capital requirements and other liabilities. 

See ""Management's Discussion and Analysis -- Liquidity and Capital Resources"" 
for a discussion of the other cash we expect to have available to us. 

We have budgeted our capital expenditures for the last three quarters of 2000

selling shareholders. 

We intend to use the proceeds of the offering for the retirement of debt, 
working capital and general corporate purposes, including sales, marketing, 
customer support and other activities related to our business. We will use 
approximately $38 million of the proceeds to repay indebtedness owed to ten 
lenders under various loan and note agreements and approximately $1.5 million 
to pay charges related to such debt reduction. This indebtedness has maturity 
dates ranging from 2000 to 2011. This indebteness has a weighted average 
interest rate of 8.0%. The indebtedness that we incurred under the loan and 
note agreements that we intend to satisfy with offering proceeds was used for 
capital expenditures, share redemptions and working capital. We may also use a 
portion of the net proceeds for additional capital expenditures, or to acquire 
additional businesses that we believe would strengthen our position in our 
targeted markets, enhance our technology base, increase our manufacturing 
capability and our product offerings and expand our geographic presence. 
However, we have no agreements or commitments to acquire any business and are 
currently not in negotiations regarding any potential acquisition. 

The amounts that we actually expend for working capital and other general 
corporate purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, 
including future revenue growth, if any, and the amount of cash we generate 
from operations. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation 
of the net proceeds of this offering. Pending such uses, we intend to invest 
the net proceeds of the initial public offering in investment grade interest- 
bearing securities."

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering for general corporate 
purposes, including the repayment of our term loan, expanding our software 
development staff and our sales and marketing capabilities, international 
expansion, possible strategic acquisitions or investments and working capital 
requirements. At June 30, 2000, we owed $2.5 million under a term loan provided 
by PNC Bank due in two equal installments on June 10, 2001 and December 10, 
2001 bearing interest at the Base Rate plus 2.25%. The term loan will be repaid 
with the proceeds of this offering. The Base Rate is the lesser of the bank's 
prime rate or the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus 2%. 

The ranges of the major uses for the net proceeds of this offering as set forth 
in our current operating plan are set forth below. These ranges are estimates 
only and are subject to change. 

- Repayment of debt of $2.5 million; 

- Research and development expenditures of between $4.0 million and $6.0 
million over the next 18 months; 

- Sales and marketing expenditures of between $12.0 million and $15.0 million

million over the next 18 months; and 

- Capital expenditures of between $3.0 million and $4.0 million over the next 
18 months. 

We believe that our capital resources, including the anticipated proceeds of 
this offering, will enable us to maintain our current and planned operations 
for at least the next 12 months. We evaluate potential strategic acquisitions 
or investments from time to time, but at the present time we have no 
understandings, commitments or agreements with respect to any such acquisition 
or investment. Pending such uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds from 
this offering in United States government securities and investment-grade, 
interest-bearing instruments. Our idle cash will be managed in accordance with 
an investment policy that management intends to propose to the Board of 
Directors for approval. The policy would authorize investments in accordance 
with strict guidelines. For example, the guidelines would allow investments 
only in high grade instruments, such as commercial paper rated A-1/P-1. 
Maturities would also be subject to these guidelines, with a maximum of one 
year. We have made no material commitments or allocations for the net proceeds, 
and the use of the proceeds will depend upon developments and opportunities in 
our business and the Internet industry in general. 
The foregoing represents our present intentions based upon our present plans

the geographic reach, customer base or breadth of product offerings of our 
existing businesses. We currently have no commitments or agreements, nor are we 
engaged in negotiations, with respect to any possible acquisitions or 
investments.

acquired, which contractually mature upon this offering and bear interest at an 
annual rate of 9.0%. 

- Approximately $5.1 million of other indebtedness assumed in our acquisition

to repay our debt to related parties as follows: 

- To repay notes payable to Dr. Gerald J. Burnett, Mr. R. Stephen Heinrichs and

diligence on the property to determine its suitability for our requirements. We 
may terminate the letter of intent for any reason during this six month period. 
If we determine to purchase the land after conducting our due diligence, we may 
then develop the land for a corporate campus for our company or sell the land 
to a third party to be developed and leased back to us. If we decide to develop 
the land ourselves, we may finance such development through the use of 
additional proceeds from this offering.

- $5.5 million to expand our research and product development efforts, 
including: 

-- approximately $5.0 million to build a pilot plant for the manufacturing of 
sodium borohydride. We expect that it will take between nine months and one 
year to complete the construction of this plant. Based on our preliminary 
estimates, we expect that this facility would be able to produce up to one ton

size AA and AAA sodium borohydride batteries. We expect that it will take 
between six months and one year to complete the construction of this battery 
line. 

- the remainder for general corporate purposes, including working capital, 
funds for operations, market development and capital expenditures. 

Although we currently have specific uses for $5.5 million of the net proceeds 
from this offering, we are seeking to raise significant additional proceeds to 
fund our net losses over at least the next three years. We expect to incur net 
losses for at least the next several years, largely due to two factors. First, 
we expect to continue to make significant investments in research and 
development activities, significantly expand the number of our employees and 
increase our general and administrative expenses, which we will fund from the 
net proceeds of this offering. Secondly, we expect that we will continue to 
incur losses until we can cost-effectively produce and sell the systems we 
develop to the mass market or broadly license our technology, both of which we

- approximately $18 million to fund our continued research and product 
development;

current plans or commitments to do so. Our management will retain broad 
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds of the offering. 

Actual uses of our net proceeds could vary from those referenced above. The 
amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous factors, 
including the status of our research and product development efforts, marketing 
and sales activities, and the growth of our manufacturing and distribution 
arrangements. We may find it necessary to use portions of the net proceeds for 
other purposes. We believe that cash from operations, together with the net 
proceeds of the sale of common stock in this offering, will be adequate to fund 
our operations for the next 18 months. 

Pending these uses, we intend to invest our net proceeds in short-term, 
investment grade securities, at prevailing market rates of interest. 

Our selling stockholders have granted to the underwriters a 30-day option to 
purchase up to 1,050,000 shares of common stock, solely to cover over-

stockholder from the sale of his shares upon exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option. See ""Principal and Selling Stockholders"". 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity capital, 
create a public market for our common stock under market conditions that we 
believe are favorable, facilitate future access by us to public equity markets 
and provide us with increased visibility in our markets. We estimate that we 
will use the net proceeds of the offering for general corporate purposes, 
including increases in both component and finished goods inventory, expansion 
of our manufacturing facilities and capacity, capital expenditures, research 
and development, sales and marketing and possible acquisitions and 
international expansion. We anticipate using approximately $2.0 million of the 
proceeds of this offering for general capital expenditures, such as the 
buildout of additional office, engineering lab and manufacturing space and 
investment in our information systems. In addition, we plan to purchase 
approximately $2.0 million of capital equipment for use in our research and 
development activities and to expand our manufacturing capacity. Additionally, 
following this offering, our board of directors may determine to use $210,000 
of our proceeds to redeem our 1992 preferred stock. As of the date of this 
prospectus, we have not allocated any specific amount of proceeds for these 
purposes. 

Notwithstanding the estimates set forth above, our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering. For 
example, we may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire businesses, 
products or technologies that are complimentary to our current or future 
business and product lines. Although we are not subject to any agreement or 
letter of intent with respect to potential acquisitions, we have from time to 
time engaged in acquisition discussions with other parties. Pending any such 
uses of the proceeds of this offering, we will invest the net proceeds of this 
offering in short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."
ADVANCED POWER TECHNOLOGY INC,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/advanced-power-technology-inc-76622-2668,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/company/advanced-power-technology-inc-76622-2668,424B1,8/8/2000,https://www.nasdaq.com/markets/ipos/filing.ashx?filingid=627146,"We estimate that our net proceeds (after we pay the underwriters and our 
expenses) from the sale of the 2,455,000 shares that we are selling will be 
$33.5 million ($38.7 million if the underwriters exercise their option to 
acquire additional shares), based upon an initial public offering price of 
$15.00 per share. We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from sales of 
our common stock to repay approximately $8.3 million in debt, plus accrued 
interest, owed to financial institutions. 

At June 30, 2000, the outstanding debt that will be repaid with the proceeds 
from this offering consists of: 

- $4.3 million outstanding under our two lines of credit, which expire in May 
2001 and bear interest at prime plus 1.0% or 1.25% based on the ratio of debt 
to equity (10.75% at June 30, 2000); 

- $2.3 million of subordinated debt outstanding under our secured credit 
agreement, which matures on September 30, 2000 and bears interest at prime plus 
1.5% (11.0% at June 30, 2000); 

- $849,000 outstanding under our European subsidiary's line of credit, which 
bears interest at Euribor plus 2% per annum (6.6% at June 30, 2000), plus 
commissions; 

- $458,000 outstanding under a term loan, which matures in March 2003 and bears 
interest at 10.6%; 

- $233,000 outstanding under a term loan, which matures in December 2003 and 
bears interest at 10.6%; 

- $83,000 outstanding under a term loan, which matures in January 2001 and 
bears interest at prime plus 1.75% (11.25% at June 30, 2000); and 

- $63,000 outstanding under a loan to our European subsidiary with no stated 
interest rate and due currently. 

We incurred approximately $3.1 million of this debt to fund the purchase of APT 
by our six senior officers. This debt includes $3.0 million initially loaned to 
our six senior officers in connection with the purchase of the remaining APT 
stock in 1998, and $100,000 loaned to those officers to pay interest on the 
note payable to Hamilton Sundstrand in connection with their initial purchase 
of APT stock in 1995. 

We expect to use the remaining net proceeds for general corporate purposes, 
which may include research and development and acquisitions. We have no current 
commitments or agreements with respect to any specific acquisition. Until we 
use the net proceeds as described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds 
in short-term government securities or other investment grade obligations. 

In addition to the net proceeds accruing directly to us, we will receive 
approximately $3.6 million from the sale of common stock by our six senior 
officers. The six senior officers estimate that they will receive approximately 
$12.2 million in net proceeds, of which approximately $3.1 million will be used 
to pay taxes resulting from the sale of their shares, $3.6 million will be used 
to pay debt and interest owed to us, $4.1 million will be used to pay debt and 
interest owed to Hamilton Sundstrand and approximately $580,000 will be used to 
repay personal debt. The debt to be repaid by these stockholders was incurred 
to fund management's purchase of APT. The net proceeds to Advanced Energy 
Industries as a selling stockholder will be an amount sufficient to pay the 
estimated taxes to be incurred as a result of the exercise of its warrants. See 
""Certain Relationships and Related Transactions."""

angina undergoing angioplasty and product development activities, including 
additional clinical trials of Angiomax; 

- fund working capital, capital expenditures and other general corporate

efforts, the amount of proceeds actually raised in this offering, the amount of 
cash generated by our operations, competition and sales and marketing 
activities. We may also use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of,

invest $6.4 million over a period of two to three years in connection with 
increasing the size of our facilities pursuant to an Approved Enterprise

pursuant to the Approved Enterprise program over the next 12 months. We expect 
that the balance of the required investment in the Approved Enterprise program 
will be financed by any proceeds of the offering remaining after this twelve- 
month period, cash on our balance sheet and our cash flow from operations. We 
will use the rest of the proceeds for working capital to support the growth of 
our business and for other general corporate purposes, including potential 
acquisitions. We currently have no agreements or understandings with respect to 
any potential acquisition and no specific plan for the use of the rest of these 
proceeds.

approximately $94.2 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment

We intend to use approximately $78.3 million of the net proceeds from this 
offering to repay existing indebtedness, which includes $69.6 million of 
indebtedness as of July 14, 2000, and $8.7 million of the $15.8 million of 
additional indebtedness that we incurred on August 1, 2000 to fund the 
acquisition of Turtle Mountain. The $8.7 million repayment consists of 
repayment of $2.4 million on a new term loan from IBM to fund a portion of the 
acquisition and repayment of a $6.3 million draw on our existing IBM credit 
facility. This new term loan bears interest at the prime rate plus 2%, for a 
current rate of 11.5%. We intend to use approximately $6.9 million of the net 
proceeds from this offering for general corporate purposes, which may include 
the funding of working capital, capital expenditures and internal expansion and 
repayment of a portion of the remaining $7.1 million we incurred to fund the 
acquisition of Turtle Mountain. To the extent we use net proceeds from this 
offering for capital expenditures, we expect that capital expenditures would 
consist primarily of equipment upgrades, acquisition of optical technology 
equipment, acquisition and upgrading of information technology systems and 
expansion of our facilities. In addition, we may acquire companies, assets or 
product lines that are complementary to ours, and a portion of the net proceeds 
may be used for these acquisitions. We do not currently have any agreements for 
any acquisitions, but we have had, and will continue to have, discussions with

As of July 14, 2000, the $69.6 million of existing indebtedness to be repaid 
from a portion of the net proceeds from this offering consisted of the 
following: 

. Approximately $38.4 million under our two revolving credit facilities with US 
Bank, excluding accrued interest, with an effective interest rate of 11.0% and 
a final maturity date of August 2002; . Approximately $31.0 million under our 
credit facility with IBM Credit Corporation, excluding accrued interest, with 
an interest rate of 10.0% and a final maturity date of May 2001; and . 
Approximately $0.2 million under non-interest bearing notes issued to Rochester 
Area Economic Development, Inc. in connection with a development assistance 
package offered to us by the City of Rochester, which are due and payable in 
the event we complete an initial public offering. 

We used borrowings under our US Bank revolving credit facilities to fund a 
portion of the purchase price for Quadrus Manufacturing and all of the purchase 
price of our Almelo, the Netherlands facility. In addition, on August 1, 2000 
we entered into an agreement amending our existing credit facility with IBM to 
provide a term loan to fund a portion of the purchase price for the acquisition 
of Turtle Mountain."

commitments or agreements to enter into any potential acquisitions and

allocate the net proceeds from this offering and the proceeds from the 
concurrent private placement with Agilent. Pending these uses, we will invest 
the net proceeds in short-term investment grade, interest-bearing instruments."

We expect to use approximately 75% of the net proceeds for commercialization 
activities, approximately 15% for clinical development of drug candidates and 
approximately 10% for general corporate purposes, including working capital and 
research expenses. In addition, we may use some of the net proceeds to hire 
additional personnel. Although we have no current plans, agreements or

use an unspecified portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
products, technologies or companies. We do not anticipate any near term 
milestone payments and do not currently intend to use proceeds from this 
offering for any near term milestone payments. Our management will have 
significant flexibility in applying the net proceeds of this offering and may 
spend the proceeds from this offering in ways that the stockholders may not 
deem desirable.

The proceeds allocated to the production and installation of Refreshment 
Centers and eRoomSafes will be used to purchase the components for the assembly 
of our Refreshment Centers and eRoomSafes and the materials for the 
installation of our Refreshment Centers and eRoomSafes. 

The proceeds allocated to the repayment of our outstanding indebtedness and 
related accrued interest have been calculated as of June 30, 2000. This 
outstanding indebtedness consists of the following: 

- Promissory notes bearing interest rates ranging from 10% to 15% per annum 
issued from 1996 to 1999 and related accrued interest in the aggregate amount 
of approximately $1,138,820, all of which are currently in default; 

- Promissory note bearing an interest rate of 10% per annum issued to RSG 
Investments, LLC, an entity in which John J. Prehn, one of our director 
designees, is a member, and related accrued interest in the amount of $818,750; 

- Repayment of bridge loan bearing an interest rate of 9% per annum and related 
accrued interest in the amount of $1,528,849; and 

- Convertible subordinated promissory notes bearing an interest rate of 7% per 
annum issued in conjunction with our Series C convertible preferred stock and 
related accrued interest in the amount of $216,062. 

On September 28, 1999, we entered into an Equipment Transfer Agreement with RSG 
Investments whereby we executed in favor of RSG Investments a promissory note 
in the original principal amount of $750,000. 

This promissory note bears an interest rate of 10% per annum and is payable on 
August 15, 2000. Since this promissory note was issued in conjunction with the 
satisfaction of our prior obligations to RSG Investments, we did not receive 
any proceeds from the issuance of this promissory note. 
On February 15, 2000, Ash Capital loaned us $500,000 in the form of a 
promissory note bearing an interest rate of 10% per annum and payable on August 
15, 2000. We used the proceeds from this loan for the production and 
installation of eRoomSystems and Refreshment Centers and general and 
administrative expenses. We have made payments of $469,658 on this promissory 
note as of June 30, 2000. 

On April 12, 2000, we closed our private placement of units, each unit 
consisting of 7% Series C convertible preferred stock, a convertible 
subordinated promissory note and warrants to purchase common stock. We used the 
gross proceeds of $850,000 from this private placement for the production and 
installation of eRoomSystems, Refreshment Centers and eRoomSafes and general 
and administrative expenses. 

On April 13, 2000, we issued a subordinated promissory note in the original 
principal amount of $1,500,000, bearing interest at the rate of 9% per annum, 
or the bridge loan, and 200,000 shares of common stock in conjunction with the 
bridge loan. We used the proceeds from the bridge loan to fund the production 
and installation of eRoomSystems, Refreshment Centers and eRoomSafes and 
general and administrative expenses. 

The above discussion represents our present intentions for the use of the 
proceeds of this offering based on our currently contemplated operations, 
business plan and the prevailing economic and industry conditions. Changes in 
the use of proceeds of this offering may be made in response to changes in our 
financial condition, business plans or growth strategy and changes in general 
industry conditions."

For a description of our acquisitions of LCG, Z-Spanish Media and two radio 
stations from Citicasters, see ""Management's Discussion and Analysis of 
Financial Condition and Results of Operations--Overview."" 

On April 20, 2000, we entered into a $115 million term loan to partially 
finance our acquisition of LCG. We expect to repay this debt in full with 
proceeds from this offering. The interest rate on this debt was 10.5% as of the 
date of this prospectus. This debt must be repaid in full by April 19, 2001 and 
can be prepaid without penalty. 

Z-Spanish Media has several credit facilities with borrowings outstanding of 
approximately $110 million as of the date of this prospectus. The interest 
rates on these facilities range from 9.6% to 11.8% and the facilities can be 
prepaid without penalty. The maturity dates of these facilities range from 
December 31, 2000 to September 30, 2006. We expect to repay this debt with 
proceeds from this offering. 

Prior to completion of this offering, Univision will make available to our 
predecessor a $70 million bridge loan to pay the purchase price for two radio 
stations from Citicasters. Our predecessor would pay to Univision a commitment 
fee of 2.25% upon funding. The $70 million bridge loan would bear interest at a 
rate of 14% per annum, would be due and payable in full on December 30, 2021 
and would require repayment on the closing of this offering. We would repay the 
entire balance with proceeds from this offering. If this offering has not 
closed by October 31, 2000, Univision would have the option, for an exercise 
price equal to the unpaid balance under the bridge note, to acquire an 
additional equity interest in us (or our predecessor, if the reorganization 
described in this prospectus has not occurred) at a price per share (or price 
per unit) equal to the price per unit of the equity option acquired by 
Univision in its $110 million investment in our predecessor in March 2000. 

We have a $158 million revolving line of credit with a group of lenders which 
expires November 10, 2006 and contains scheduled quarterly reductions in the 
available borrowings through such date. At March 31, 2000, the borrowings 
outstanding were approximately $96.9 million with an interest rate of 8.165%. 
We expect to repay all of this debt with proceeds from this offering, as well 
as additional indebtness incurred under this facility since March 31, 2000. 

Until we use the net proceeds of this offering as described above, we will 
invest them in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

common stock offered by us at an assumed initial public offering price of 
$15.00 per share, after deducting estimated underwriting discounts and 
estimated offering expenses, will be approximately $72.5 million. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling shareholders if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised. We intend to use 
approximately $40.0 million of the net proceeds from the offering to repay 
outstanding bank debt under our existing credit agreement with Bank of America, 
N.A. This debt consists of a $25.0 million term loan due September 30, 2004 and 
a $25.0 million revolving line of credit, under which we have drawn 
approximately $15.0 million. Both the term loan and the revolving line of 
credit bear interest at a rate of LIBOR as of the date of borrowing plus 1.50% 
(currently, 8.14%). The entire amount of debt outstanding under the credit 
facility with Bank of America, N.A. was drawn on October 29, 1999, the date of 
initial funding, and all of this debt was used to repay other outstanding bank 
debt, which bore interest at a higher rate. 

The balance of the net proceeds from this offering will be used to pay amounts 
due upon the automatic conversion of our preferred stock and for general 
corporate purposes. The terms of our outstanding preferred stock provide that 
the currently outstanding shares will automatically convert into a right to 
receive cash and common stock upon consummation of this offering pursuant to a 
formula based upon the aggregate redemption price of the outstanding preferred 
stock plus the cumulative dividends which are accrued but unpaid on that stock.
 These outstanding shares will convert into an aggregate of $23.7 million in 
cash and an aggregate of 1,580,939 shares of common stock. The number of shares 
of common stock which will be outstanding after this offering as reflected 
throughout this prospectus includes the issuance of these shares. The $23.7 
million in cash which will be paid to the 175 holders of our preferred stock 
represents a transfer payment to these shareholders and will not be available 
to fund our expansion or for other corporate purposes. 

Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds

be approximately $30.2 million, based on the initial public offering price of 
$7.00 per share and after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and 
estimated expenses payable by us. We will not receive any proceeds from the 
sale of common stock to be sold by the selling stockholders if the overallotment 
option is exercised; however, out of the proceeds Mr. Montgomery receives from 
any shares sold upon exercise of the overallotment option, he will repay his 
outstanding loan from us plus accrued interest.  

Based on the initial public offering price of $7.00 per share, we will receive 
approximately $2.1 million of proceeds from the sale of our common stock to 
Cinergy Communications, Inc. in the concurrent private placement. We received 
$10,000,000 from the sale of our common stock to Cinergy Communications in June 
2000. 

We intend to use a portion of the proceeds we receive from this offering and the 
concurrent private placement to repay outstanding indebtedness under our 
revolving credit facility plus accrued interest. At March 31, 2000, outstanding 
borrowings under this agreement totaled approximately $21.8 million. Borrowings 
under the facility bear interest, at our option, at either a floating rate based 
on LIBOR or on the lending bank's prime rate. At March 31, 2000, borrowings 
under the facility bore interest at a blended rate of 9.27% per annum. 
Borrowings under the facility were used to partially fund the purchase of our 
previously outstanding Series A and Series B Preferred Stock and Class A Common 
Stock in connection with our 1999 recapitalization. Borrowings under the 
facility mature on August 12, 2003. We also intend to use a portion of the 
proceeds we receive from this offering and the concurrent private placement to 
pay to InSight Capital Partners, one of our largest stockholders, certain fees 
due it. Through affiliated entities, InSight acquired a 22.9% interest in us as 
part of our 1999 recapitalization. In connection with negotiating the terms of 
the recapitalization, we agreed to pay to InSight a fee at the time of our 
initial public offering and a fee for management and strategic advice provided 
by InSight to us up through the date of the initial public offering. Based on 
the number of shares of common stock expected to be outstanding upon 
consummation of this offering and the initial offering price of $7.00 per share, 
the fee payable to InSight Capital Partners will be approximately $3.0 million.  

We intend to use the remaining net proceeds we receive from this offering, the 
concurrent private placement and the sale of our common stock in June 2000 to 
Cinergy Communications, aggregating approximately $16.9 million, for working 
capital and general corporate purposes, including advertising and marketing our 
brands and expanding our sales, project management and marketing staffs. We 
believe that cash from operations, borrowings available under our revolving 
credit facility or a new credit facility and the net proceeds of this offering, 
the concurrent private placement and the sale of our common stock in June 2000 
to Cinergy Communications, after payment of the InSight fees and repayment of 
amounts outstanding under our revolving credit facility, will be sufficient to 
meet our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the 
next twelve months. 

Except for the repayment of outstanding indebtedness and the payment of the fee 
to InSight Capital Partners, we have not identified any specific expenditure 
plans with respect to the proceeds we received from the June 2000 sale of common 
stock to Cinergy Communications and which we will receive from this offering and 
the concurrent private placement, and our management will have broad discretion 
in the application of these net proceeds. A portion of the net proceeds may be 
used to acquire or invest in complementary businesses, technologies, products 
or services or to invest in geographic expansion. Although we are not 
contemplating any specific acquisitions at this time and no portion of the net 
proceeds has been allocated for any acquisition, we evaluate acquisition 
opportunities on an ongoing basis. Pending use, we intend to invest the net 
proceeds in interest bearing, investment-grade instruments, certificates of 
deposit or direct or guaranteed obligations of the United States."

follows: 

. 15% for research and development, 

. 35% for sales and marketing, 

. 10% for capital expenditures, and 

. 40% for working capital, and other general corporate purposes. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend on numerous 
factors, including market acceptance of our speech-activated e-business 
solutions and services, the amount of cash generated by our operations and 
products and services introduced by competitors. We may also use a portion of 
the net proceeds to acquire or invest in businesses or technologies that are 
complementary to our business. However, we have not targeted any particular 
technology or business for acquisition. We have no current agreements or 
commitments nor are we negotiating with any other party with respect to any 
acquisitions or investments. Our management will have broad discretion

interest-bearing securities. We believe that the net proceeds of this offering

We currently estimate that we will use the net proceeds as follows: 
approximately 15% to 25% to hire additional engineers for research and 
development, approximately 20% to 30% to hire additional personnel to expand 
our sales and marketing activities and the remainder for general corporate 
purposes, including working capital. The amount we spend and the timing of the

arises, use an unspecified portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in 
products, technologies or companies. Our management will have broad discretion

our actual expenditures will be based on many factors, including cash flows

million from the sale of 8,625,000 shares of common stock if the underwriters 
exercise their over-allotment option in full. These estimates reflect an 
initial public offering price of $12.00 per share and the deduction of the 
underwriting discount and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable 
by us. 

The principal purposes of the offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future access to 
public equity markets. We expect to use a portion of the net proceeds from the 
offering to repay outstanding indebtedness. We expect to use approximately $9.1 
million of the net proceeds to prepay a term loan which matures on November 1, 
2002, referred to as Term Loan A. In addition, we expect to use approximately 
$12.0 million of the net proceeds to prepay a term loan which matures on 
November 1, 2004, referred to as Term Loan B. The interest rates of Term Loan A 
and Term Loan B were 9.25% and 11.75%, respectively, as of July 28, 2000. Term 
Loan A and Term Loan B are required to be repaid in full as a result of the 
offering. We used the borrowings under Term Loan A and Term Loan B to effect 
the recapitalization of Western Multiplex which occurred on November 1, 1999. 
For a description of the recapitalization transaction, see ""Material 
Relationships and Related Transactions"" beginning on page 57. 

As of the date of this prospectus, we have not allocated the remaining net 
proceeds of the offering for specific uses. We expect to use the remainder of 
the net proceeds of the offering primarily for general corporate purposes, 
including working capital, expansion of our engineering organization, product 
development programs, sales and marketing capabilities, and general 
administrative functions and capital expenditures. We may use the net proceeds 
from the offering to repay outstanding indebtedness under our revolving credit 
facility which expires on November 1, 2002. The interest rate of the revolving 
credit loans was 9.25% as of July 28, 2000. We have used the borrowings under 
the revolving credit facility to finance our working capital needs. We may also 
use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire complementary businesses, products 
and technologies or to establish joint ventures that we believe will complement 
our current or future business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements 
or commitments and are not currently engaged in any negotiations for any 
acquisition or joint venture. 

We have not identified the specific use of the net proceeds due to the flexible 
nature of our planning process. The amounts that we actually expend for general 
corporate and other purposes will vary significantly depending on a number of 
factors, including future sales growth and the amount of cash we generate from 
operations, if any. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the 
allocation of and reserve the right to change the use of net proceeds of the 
offering. Because of this discretion, we may use the net proceeds of the 
offering in ways with which you disagree. Pending the use of the proceeds

million, which amount is based on the amount of undistributed earnings notes as 
of June 30, 2000 and amounts outstanding under our line of credit as of 
September 28, 2000, representing approximately 32.8% of the total net proceeds, 
for working capital and general corporate purposes, including expansion of 
sales and marketing activities, enhancement of our technology, possible 
acquisitions and possible international expansion. We have not reserved or 
allocated the balance of the net proceeds for any specific transaction, and we 
cannot specify with certainty how we will use the balance of the net proceeds. 
The amounts and timing of our actual expenses will depend on numerous factors, 
including the status of our product development efforts, sales and marketing 
activities, technological advances, the amount of cash generated or used by our 
operations and competition. We may find it necessary or advisable to use 
portions of the balance of the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will 
have broad discretion in the application of the balance of the net proceeds. 
Pending these other uses, we intend to invest the balance of the net proceeds 
in short-term, interest-bearing, investment grade securities."

estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses payable by us. We expect to receive approximately $86.8 million if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to increase our equity capital, 
create a public market for our common stock, facilitate future access by us to 
public capital markets and provide us with increased visibility in our markets. 
We have no specific plans for the use of the net proceeds of this offering and 
intend to use such proceeds for general corporate purposes, principally working 
capital for increased domestic and international sales and marketing 
expenditures, product development expenditures, expenditures related to the 
expansion of our consulting services organization and capital expenditures made 
in the ordinary course of business. We may also use a portion of the net 
proceeds to expand internationally, to acquire or invest in additional 
businesses, products and technologies that we believe will complement our 
current or future business. However, we have no specific plans, agreements or 
commitments, oral or written, to do so. We are not currently engaged in any 
negotiations for any acquisition or strategic investment. The amounts that we 
actually expend for working capital purposes will vary significantly depending 
on a number of factors, including future revenue growth, if any, the amount of 
cash we generate from operations and the progress of our product development 
efforts. As a result, we will retain broad discretion in the allocation of the 
net proceeds of this offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest 
the net proceeds in short-term, interest-bearing, investment-grade securities."

full, from the sale of shares of common stock offered by us in this prospectus, 
after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering 
expenses. We will not receive any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the 
selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds from this offering, as well as up to 
approximately $25 million in cash generated from operations, during the next 
eighteen months as follows: 

- first, we intend to expand our capacity to produce premium tubular 
connections in the United States and Canada and to upgrade machine tools that 
we use in the manufacturing of our pressure control products, at a total 
estimated cost of between $30 and $40 million; and 

- second, we intend to use any remaining net proceeds and any required cash 
from operations to finance the continued development and commercialization of 
new, advanced technologies and products, including subsea mudlift drilling 
technology and advanced composite tubing, at a total estimated cost of between 
$10 and $20 million. 

For further discussion of our liquidity and capital expenditures, see 
""Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of 
Operations -- Liquidity and Capital Resources."" 

Pending application of the proceeds for those purposes, we intend to invest the 
excess cash in short-term investment grade securities, reduce our borrowings 
under our revolving credit facility with Bank One Texas, National Association, 
or a combination of both. The Bank One revolving facility matures July 1, 2001 
and bears interest, at our election, at 0.75% over Bank One's prime rate or 
2.5% over LIBOR. At June 30, 2000, approximately $13.3 million was outstanding 
under the Bank One revolving facility at a weighted average interest rate of 
9.43%, with another approximately $1.7 million available for borrowing, subject 
to limitations. Our amended revolving facility with Bank One, which will be 
effective upon completion of this offering and will terminate March 31, 2003, 
bears interest, at our election, at either a prime or LIBOR based interest 
rate. Interest rates under the amended facility fluctuate depending on our 
leverage ratio and will be prime plus a spread ranging from zero to 25 basis 
points or LIBOR plus a spread ranging from 125 to 225 basis points."

initial public offering price of $16.00 per share, after deducting underwriting 
discounts and commissions and the estimated offering expenses. We will not 
receive any proceeds from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend to use the net proceeds we receive as follows: 

- approximately $50.6 million to reduce our indebtedness under our senior 
credit facility; 

- approximately $10.8 million to eliminate our obligations under our retention 
bonus plan; 

- approximately $12.8 million to redeem all of our outstanding senior 
subordinated notes; 

- approximately $4.0 million to redeem our outstanding subordinated note; and 

- approximately $3.5 million in management consulting and financial advisory 
fees. 

Pending these uses, we will invest the net proceeds we receive in short-term, 
interest-bearing, investment-grade securities. Of the $81.7 million total net 
proceeds we will use, our affiliates will receive approximately $8.8 million, 
including approximately $3.5 million in management consulting and financial 
advisory fees and $5.3 million payable to four of our officers upon termination 
of our retention bonus plan. See ""Related Party Transactions"" for a more 
detailed description of our obligations to these affiliates. 

Our senior credit facility consists of multi-tranche term loans, a revolving 
loan and a swingline loan, with an aggregate principal balance of approximately 
$111.6 million as of July 3, 2000. The Tranche A term facility amortizes in 20 
quarterly installments through June 30, 2004. The Tranche B term facility 
amortizes in 24 quarterly installments through June 30, 2005. The revolving 
line of credit and swingline commitment each expire on June 30, 2004. 

Our borrowings under the senior credit facility bear interest at varying rates 
based, at our option, on either LIBOR plus 225 to 325 basis points or the 
alternate base rate plus 75 to 150 basis points, in the case of Tranche A and 
revolving loans, and LIBOR plus 350 to 375 basis points or the alternate base 
rate plus 225 basis points in the case of Tranche B. The alternate base rate is 
the greater of (i) the lender's prime rate or (ii) the effective rate for 
federal funds plus 50 basis points. The amount added to the LIBOR rate or the 
alternate base rate varies depending upon our leverage ratios. The weighted 
average interest rate for all of our loans under this facility was 10.4% at 
July 3, 2000. We used borrowings under our senior credit facility to refinance 
indebtedness incurred in connection with our leveraged recapitalization in 
December 1998 and to partially fund our acquisition of Power Circuits in July 
1999. Prior to the effectiveness of the registration statement of which this 
prospectus forms a part, we received the consent of the lenders under the 
senior credit facility to the uses of the net proceeds described above. We are 
currently planning to refinance the senior credit facility shortly after this 
offering and are negotiating an amended and restated credit agreement. We can 
provide no assurances that we will actually refinance the senior credit 
facility. See ""Description of Indebtedness"" for a more detailed description of 
the senior credit facility. 

In July 1999, we issued an aggregate of $12.5 million in senior subordinated 
notes to TCW/Crescent Mezzanine Partners II, L.P., TCW/Crescent Mezzanine Trust 
II, TCW Leveraged Income Trust, L.P. and TCW Leveraged Income Trust II, L.P., 
each of which is a stockholder. The senior subordinated notes mature in January 
2006 and bear interest at 12.0%. We used the proceeds from the issuance of 
these notes to partially fund our acquisition of Power Circuits in July 1999. 
In December 1998, Lewis O. Coley, III, our former majority owner, director and 
president, made a loan to us for approximately $4.0 million secured by a 
subordinated note. The subordinated note accrues interest at a rate of 10% per 
year and matures in December 2006. We used the proceeds of the note issued to 
Mr. Coley to partially finance our leveraged recapitalization in December 1998. 
Also in December 1998, we entered into a retention bonus plan that provides 
four of our officers and several other key employees with an ongoing incentive 
to remain employed by us. Under the agreement, we are required to pay, subject 
to certain conditions, an aggregate of $12.0 million to these officers and 
employees. The retention bonuses vest over a period of five years at a rate of 
25% for each of the first three years and 12.5% for each of the remaining two 
years. In addition, we are required to make payments which accrue at a rate of 
10% per annum on the total unpaid retention bonuses. In connection with the use 
of proceeds from this offering, we intend to redeem our outstanding senior 
subordinated notes and our subordinated note and eliminate our obligations 
under our retention bonus plan. See ""Related Party Transactions--Retention 
Bonus Plan"" and "" -- Note to Lewis O. Coley, III"" for a more detailed 
description of the subordinated notes and retention bonus plan."

net proceeds will be $57.6 million. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working 
capital, create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future 
access by Zengine to public equity markets. We generally intend to use the net 
proceeds of this offering as follows: 

- hiring of additional technical, direct sales and marketing personnel 
(approximately $9 million); 

- expansion of our market activities (approximately $12 million); 

- capital expenditures (approximately $5 million); and 

- working capital (approximately $24.5 million). 

In addition, we may, if appropriate opportunities arise, use an undetermined 
portion of the net proceeds to engage in strategic alliances or to acquire or 
invest in complementary companies, product or service lines, or technologies. 
While we engage in discussions relating to strategic alliances or potential 
investments which complement our existing business on an on-going basis, we do 
not have any agreements or commitments with respect to any proposed alliance, 
acquisition or investment. Pending such uses, we will invest the net proceeds 
in investment grade, interest-bearing securities."

lines of credit was $191,000, $25,000 of which was outstanding under our 
working capital revolving line of credit with Bank Hapoalim. The working 
capital revolving line of credit with Bank Hapoalim bears interest annually at 
the London interbank offered rate plus 1.5%. Our other lines of credit bear 
interest at annual rates equal to the prime rate of the lending bank plus 1% or 
the prime rate of the lending bank plus 0.25%.

We expect that $42 million of the proceeds of this offering, together with bank 
financing expected to be available under our new $120 million bank facility, 
other financing that we have applied for and cash from operations, will be 
adequate to finance the purchase of two additional ultra-premium jackup rigs, 
one of which is currently under construction. 

SEACOR holds approximately $26.7 million aggregate principal amount of our 
outstanding senior notes. SEACOR also holds an economic interest in 
substantially all of our remaining outstanding senior notes. SEACOR and the 
other holder of these senior notes have agreed to sell their holdings of those 
senior notes to us at a price equal to the par value of the senior notes, plus 
any accrued and unpaid interest to the purchase date. SEACOR will report a pre-

overhead expenses associated with management, human resources, corporate 
marketing, information management systems, quality assurance and finance. We

expenses to remain, as a percentage of revenue, generally consistent with such

Phase III clinical trials using the Delcath system with doxorubicin. These 
costs represent: 

o the costs of recruiting medical centers to conduct the trials and patients to 
participate in the trials; 

o the costs of treating patients, including the costs of the Delcath system and 
payments for unreimbursed medical expenses for patients receiving treatment 
with the system; and 

o the costs of approximately $950,000 for the fees and expenses of the clinical 
research organization which we anticipate hiring to conduct the trials, collect 
and process the data and prepare and file a pre-market approval application and 
approximately $550,000 for associated overhead, including the costs of 
additional personnel and consultants. 

We estimate that the average costs to treat a patient will be under $20,000, 
and we expect to treat up to 124 patients. 

Research and development stage clinical trials for other chemotherapy agents. 
This amount represents the costs of conducting research and development stage 
clinical trials for the use of other chemotherapy agents with the Delcath 
system for the treatment of liver cancer. These costs represent the costs of 
non-animal testing, animal testing, testing with humans, monitoring the testing 
and collecting and processing data. Additional financing will be required to 
conduct Phase II and III clinical trials. 

Repayment of indebtedness. Represents amounts to be used to repay $230,000 
principal amount of promissory notes plus interest. These notes were issued in 
August and September 2000, bear interest at an annual rate of 22% and are due 
May 27, 2001. We are using the proceeds of these loans for working capital. 

Working capital and general corporate purposes. These costs include general and 
administrative costs, including the salaries of our executive officers. 

If the underwriter exercises the over-allotment option in full, we will realize 
additional net proceeds of $939,600, which will be added to working capital 
purposes. 

The above allocation represents our best estimate of the allocation of the net 
proceeds of this offering based upon the current status of our business. We 
based this estimate on assumptions, including that the Delcath system will have 
obtained FDA pre-marketing approval within 24 months from the closing of this 
offering. If any of these factors change, we may find it necessary to 
reallocate a portion of the proceeds within the above described categories or 
use portions of the proceeds for other purposes. Our estimates may prove to be 
inaccurate, new programs or activities may be undertaken which will require 
considerable additional expenditures or unforeseen expenses may occur. 

Based upon our current plans and assumptions relating to our business plan, we 
anticipate that the net proceeds of this offering will satisfy our capital 
requirements for at least 12 months following the closing of this offering. If 
our plans change or our assumptions prove to be inaccurate, we may need to seek 
additional financing sooner than currently anticipated or curtail our 
operations. We cannot assure you that the proceeds of this offering will be 
sufficient to fund our clinical trials with respect to the use of the Delcath 
system with doxorubicin to treat liver cancer. We also cannot assure you that 
additional financing will become available if needed. 
We will invest proceeds not immediately required for the purposes described 
above principally in United States government securities, short-term 
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term 
interest-bearing investments."

offering cannot be determined until the offering is completed, it is presently
anticipated that the net proceeds will be between $10.3 million and $14.2
million, or $16.5 million if the offering range is increased by 15%. See ""Pro
Forma Data"" and ""The Conversion--Share Exchange Ratio"" and ""--Stock Pricing and
Number of Shares to be Issued"" as to the assumptions used to arrive at these
amounts. Finger Lakes Bancorp will be unable to use any of the net proceeds of
the offering until the consummation of the conversion.
     Finger Lakes Bancorp estimates that it will use between $5.2 million and
$7.1 million, or $8.3 million if the offering range is increased by 15%, to
purchase all of the capital stock of Savings Bank of the Finger Lakes to be
issued upon conversion. Finger Lakes Bancorp will retain approximately 50% of
the net proceeds, a portion of which is expected to be used to fund the loan to
the employee stock ownership plan. The balance of funds retained by Finger Lakes
Bancorp will be used for general corporate purposes. These purposes may include
investment in federal funds, short-term investment grade marketable securities
and mortgage-backed securities.
     The loan to the employee stock ownership plan will enable it to purchase up
to 8% of the shares of Finger Lakes Bancorp common stock issued in the offering.
Finger Lakes Bancorp and Savings Bank of the Finger Lakes may also elect to fund
the employee stock ownership plan's stock purchases through a loan by a third
party financial institution. We may also determine to fund the employee stock
ownership plan through open market purchases of common stock following
completion of the offering. See ""Management of Finger Lakes Financial--
Benefits."" The net proceeds retained by Finger Lake Bancorp may also be used to
support the future expansion by offering new products and banking services of
operations through branch acquisitions, the establishment of new branch offices,
and the acquisition of other financial institutions or diversification into
other banking related businesses. Neither Finger Lakes Bancorp nor Savings Bank
of the Finger Lakes has any current specific plans, arrangements or
understandings regarding any additional expansions or acquisitions at this time,
nor have criteria been established to identify potential candidates for
acquisition."

$33.1 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full),
at an assumed initial public offering price of $8.00 per share, after deducting
the underwriting discount and estimated offering expenses.
     The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional working
capital, to create a public market for our common stock and to facilitate future
access by us to public markets. We expect to use the net proceeds from this
offering to conduct research and development, including clinical trials, advance
our process development and manufacturing capabilities, initiate product
marketing and commercialization programs, and for general corporate purposes,
including working capital. We are not currently able to estimate the allocation
of proceeds specifically, and we will have broad discretion to use the proceeds
as we see fit. Pending use of the net proceeds of this offering, we intend to
invest the net proceeds in short term, interest bearing, investment grade
securities or guaranteed obligations of the United States Government.
     We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire or invest in
complementary businesses or products or to obtain the right to use complementary
technologies. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, we have
evaluated and expect to continue to evaluate and discuss with interested parties
potential acquisitions of businesses, products or technologies. Other than
acquiring or maintaining rights to technologies in the ordinary course of our
business, we have no present agreements or commitments regarding any such
transaction."

proceeds of the 200,000 shares that will be sold by our majority shareholders, 
Kenneth S. McElvain and Alisa Yaffa, if the underwriters exercise their

. fund our capital expenditures; and 

. fund any potential acquisitions of complementary products, technologies or

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures for working capital purposes 
will vary significantly depending on a number of factors, including future 
revenue growth, if any, the amount of cash we generate from operations and 
competitive and technological developments. As a result, we will retain broad 
discretion in the allocation of the net proceeds from this offering. In 
addition, we may use a portion of the net proceeds for further development of 
our product lines and for acquisitions of or investments in products, 
technologies and businesses. However, we currently have no present plans, 
commitments or agreements with respect to any acquisitions or investments. We 
have not yet determined the manner in which we will allocate the net proceeds

sale of the 10,000,000 shares of common stock offered by this prospectus, after 
deducting underwriting fees and estimated offering expenses payable by us. This 
amount is based on a public offering price of $16.50 per share. 

We intend to use the net proceeds of this offering along with borrowings of 
approximately $78.8 million under our new credit facility: 

- to repay in full, for a cash payment of approximately $157.9 million, the 
outstanding balance under our existing credit facility, plus accrued and unpaid

the commitment and arranging and administrative services for our new credit

Pending such uses, the net proceeds of this offering will be invested in 
short-term, investment grade, interest-bearing securities. 

The selling shareholders will sell shares of common stock to the underwriters

any proceeds from the sale of common stock by the selling shareholders. See 
""Principal and Selling Shareholders."" 

The borrowings outstanding under our existing credit facility bear interest at 
floating rates equal to the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) plus a 
margin that depends on our debt coverage ratio. These borrowings mature between 
August 2002 and March 2005. For the six months ended June 30, 2000, the 
weighted average applicable interest rate under our existing credit facility 
was 10.51%. Amounts borrowed under our existing credit facility were used to 
fund our recapitalization in 1997, our acquisitions of Integrity Industries, 
Inc., Diamond Wireline Services, Inc., Grinding and Sizing Company, Inc. and 
Agri- Empresa, Inc. and for general corporate purposes. 

We have received a commitment from DLJ Capital Funding, Inc. (an affiliate of 
Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette Securities Corporation) to provide a new credit 
facility at or prior to the closing of this offering. Borrowings under our new 
credit facility will be used, along with a portion of the proceeds of this 
offering, as described above. Please read ""Management's Discussion and Analysis 
of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Liquidity and Capital 
Resources"" for a description of the anticipated terms of our new credit 
facility. 

Our 13% senior subordinated notes bear interest at 13% per annum and are due in 
April 2006. The proceeds from the sale of our 13% senior subordinated notes 
were used to fund the PathFinder acquisition. Our 13% senior subordinated notes 
and the related payment-in-kind notes, which bear interest at 14% per annum and 
mature April 1, 2006, were issued to and are held by DLJ Merchant Banking

our 12 1/2% senior subordinated notes and the related payment-in-kind notes,

     We may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire additional clinical
research businesses. We are not currently engaged in any negotiations, but we
do have an option to buy a Phase I clinical research firm for approximately
$600,000. We do not intend to consider making this acquisition unless and until
we have an opportunity to review audited financial statements of this business.
See ""Business--Summary of Our Acquisition of Pharmaceutical Development
Associates' Assets."" We are not sure that we will make any future acquisitions
and, if we do, whether we will pay cash or issue our securities. Our management
will have broad discretion in how we spend these net proceeds.
     We entered into a $1,500,000 line of credit with Heller Healthcare
Finance, Inc. on January 31, 2000 and borrowed the amount necessary to purchase
the assets of Pharmaceutical Development Associates on March 29, 2000. The line
of credit is payable on January 31, 2002 and bears interest of 1.75% above the
lender's prime rate with a minimum interest rate of 10% per annum. We also are
paying notes held by 12 of our minority stockholders, which bear 10% interest
per annum. These minority stockholders are not officers, directors or 5%
stockholders of SFBC. These notes are past due. We have not paid these notes
because no request for payment has been made.
     A substantial portion of the proceeds has been allocated to working
capital. We may use a substantial portion of the proceeds devoted to working
capital to support the growth of our business pending collection of our
accounts receivable. We use our line of credit to supplement our working
capital. The amount available for use to borrow under our line of credit varies
from day-to-day. As we collect our accounts receivable, we pay down our line of
credit.
     Based upon our contemplated operations, business plans, and current
economic and industry conditions, the above is our best estimate of the amount,
timing, and allocation of the expenditures of the net proceeds of this
offering. These estimated amounts are subject to reallocation within the listed
categories or to new categories in response to a number of unanticipated
events. These may include changes in our business plans, new government
regulations, changing industry conditions, and future revenues and
expenditures. For example, if we move to a larger facility, we may need to use
an additional $200,000 for this purpose, although we do not expect to encounter
this additional expense at this time.
     We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with
anticipated revenues from operations, will be sufficient to meet our presently
anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least
12 months. Our belief is based on our operating plan, which in turn is based on
assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, our financial
resources may not be
sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for this period. In addition, we
may need to raise significant additional funds sooner in order to support our
growth, develop new or enhanced services, respond to competitive pressures,
acquire or invest in complementary or competitive businesses, or take advantage
of unanticipated opportunities. If our financial resources are insufficient we
may require additional financing in order to meet our plans for expansion. We
cannot be sure that this additional financing, if needed, will be available on
acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, any additional debt financing, if
available, may involve restrictive covenants, which may limit our operating
flexibility with respect to business matters. If additional funds are raised
through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our
existing stockholders will be reduced, our stockholders may experience
additional dilution in net book value per share, and such new equity securities
may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our existing
stockholders. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may
be unable to develop or enhance our services, take advantage of future
opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to
competitive pressures.
     Pending the use of proceeds as disclosed above, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in the United States Government securities, short-term of
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term,
interest-bearing investment grade securities."

from day-to-day. As we collect our accounts receivable, we pay down our line of
credit.
     Based upon our contemplated operations, business plans, and current
economic and industry conditions, the above is our best estimate of the amount,
timing, and allocation of the expenditures of the net proceeds of this
offering. These estimated amounts are subject to reallocation within the listed
categories or to new categories in response to a number of unanticipated
events. These may include changes in our business plans, new government
regulations, changing industry conditions, and future revenues and
expenditures. For example, if we move to a larger facility, we may need to use
an additional $200,000 for this purpose, although we do not expect to encounter
this additional expense at this time.
     We believe that the net proceeds from this offering, together with
anticipated revenues from operations, will be sufficient to meet our presently
anticipated working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least
12 months. Our belief is based on our operating plan, which in turn is based on
assumptions, which may prove to be incorrect. As a result, our financial
resources may not be
sufficient to satisfy our capital requirements for this period. In addition, we
may need to raise significant additional funds sooner in order to support our
growth, develop new or enhanced services, respond to competitive pressures,
acquire or invest in complementary or competitive businesses, or take advantage
of unanticipated opportunities. If our financial resources are insufficient we
may require additional financing in order to meet our plans for expansion. We
cannot be sure that this additional financing, if needed, will be available on
acceptable terms or at all. Furthermore, any additional debt financing, if
available, may involve restrictive covenants, which may limit our operating
flexibility with respect to business matters. If additional funds are raised
through the issuance of equity securities, the percentage ownership of our
existing stockholders will be reduced, our stockholders may experience
additional dilution in net book value per share, and such new equity securities
may have rights, preferences, or privileges senior to those of our existing
stockholders. If adequate funds are not available on acceptable terms, we may
be unable to develop or enhance our services, take advantage of future
opportunities, repay debt obligations as they become due, or respond to
competitive pressures.
     Pending the use of proceeds as disclosed above, we intend to invest the
net proceeds in the United States Government securities, short-term of
certificates of deposit, money market funds or other short-term,
interest-bearing investment grade securities."

the net proceeds from our anticipated concurrent debt offering (at an assumed
public offering price of $10.00 per share), will be approximately $896 million,
or $972 million if the underwriters exercise in full their option to purchase
additional shares from us, after deducting assumed underwriting discounts and
estimated offering expenses.

We expect to use the net proceeds of the offerings as follows: 

- approximately $680 million for the construction of our network; 

- approximately $125 million to make investments in telecommunications and 
Internet companies, and related businesses; 

- approximately $9.6 million to repay outstanding indebtedness under 
shareholder loans at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 2%; 

- up to approximately $79 million to purchase from Global Crossing shareholder 
loans and future commitments it made to Hutchison Global Crossing and Global 
Access Limited. The shareholder loans to Hutchison Global Crossing bear an 
interest rate equal to the Hong Kong Dollar Interbank Offered Rate, or HIBOR. 
The shareholder loans to Global Access Limited bear an interest rate equal to 
1.5% above the long-term prime lending rate quoted by the Industrial Bank of 
Japan; and 

- the balance for general corporate purposes, including the funding of operating 
losses. 

Pending those uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in direct or guaranteed 
obligations of the United States, interest-bearing, investment-grade instruments 
or certificates of deposit. 

Since we cannot specify with certainty the precise manner in which the net 
proceeds will be allocated, our management will have broad discretion in the 
application of the net proceeds."

be approximately $86.0 million, or $99.1 million if the underwriters exercise theiri
 over-allotment option in full, after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions,
 and after deducting our estimated offering expenses. 

The principal purposes of this offering are to obtain additional capital, to 
create a public market for our common stock, and to enhance our ability to 
acquire businesses, products or technologies through the use of our common stock.
 We expect to use the net proceeds of this offering primarily to fund operating
 losses and for working capital and other general corporate purposes, including 
increased expenditures for research and development and sales and marketing, as
 well as capital expenditures, to implement our business strategies. In addition,
 we may use a portion of the net proceeds for the acquisition of businesses, 
products and technologies that are complementary to ours. However, we have no 
current plans, agreements or commitments and are not currently engaged in any 
negotiations with respect to any acquisition. 

No specific amount has been allocated to any particular purpose. However, we 
presently intend to use approximately $30.0 to $40.0 million to expand our research 
and development efforts, approximately $25.0 to $35.0 million on sales and marketing 
activities, and approximately $5.0 to $10.0 million for capital expenditures. The
 amount we actually spend for any of the purposes above will vary significantly
 depending on a number of factors, including competitive and technological 
developments, the amount of cash used in our operations, the rate of growth, if
 any, of our business, and the availability of appropriate opportunities to 
acquire complementary businesses or technologies. Pending these uses, we intend
 to invest the net proceeds of this offering in investment grade, interest-
bearing securities. 

Our management will have considerable discretion in the application of the net
 proceeds of this offering and you will not have the opportunity, as part of 
your investment decision, to assess whether the proceeds are being used
 appropriately. The net proceeds may be used for corporate purposes that do not
 increase our profitability or our market value. Pending application of the 
proceeds, they may be placed in investments that lose value."

to repay a portion of an intercompany note payable to a subsidiary of Sara Lee.
We will assume the note in connection with our separation from Sara Lee. The
note represents our allocable portion of indebtedness of Sara Lee. The note will
have an initial aggregate principal amount of $190 million and will mature on
September 30, 2002. The note will be subject to mandatory prepayment out of our
excess cash flow after payment of all amounts outstanding under our revolving

We anticipate using the net proceeds from this offering for advancing our drug 
candidates through preclinical and later stage development, discovering or 
acquiring new drug candidates, expanding our technology platform, capital 
expenditures, working capital, general corporate purposes and possible future 
acquisitions. The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend 
upon numerous factors, including the status of our product development and 
commercialization efforts, technological advances, the amount of proceeds 
actually raised in this offering and the amount of cash generated by our 
operations. We may use a portion of the proceeds for the acquisition of, or 
investment in, companies, technologies or assets that complement our business, 
although we are not currently planning any acquisitions, and no portion of the 
net proceeds has been allocated to any particular acquisition. We have not 
determined the amounts we plan to spend on any of the areas listed above or the 
timing of these expenditures. As a result, our management will have broad 
discretion to allocate the net proceeds from this offering. 

We believe that the net proceeds of this offering, existing cash, cash 
equivalents and investments, will be sufficient to meet our operating expenses 
and capital requirements for at least the next 24 months. Pending the use of 
the net proceeds, we intend to invest the net proceeds in interest-bearing

businesses, products and technologies and to establishing joint ventures or 
other collaborative arrangements which we believe complement our current or 
future business. We anticipate that the remaining portion of the offering 
proceeds would be allocated approximately one-third to expanding research and 
development, approximately one-third to expanding sales and marketing and 
approximately one-third to working capital and general corporate purposes. We 
have no specific plans, agreements or commitments to use the proceeds for any 
specific acquisition or collaborative arrangement and, to the extent appropriate 
opportunities are not available, all proceeds not allocated to external 
expansion would be applied to internal expansion, through expanding our research

and our existing capital resources will be sufficient to fund our operations for 
the next 24 months, but it is possible that our growth will require us to seek 
additional financing during this period."

the underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full, we estimate that
the net proceeds will be approximately $102.0 million.
      We anticipate using the net proceeds from the offering for general
corporate purposes, including the continued development of existing product
candidates, manufacturing, commercialization expenditures, research and
development for additional product opportunities, hiring of sales, marketing,
development, research and administrative personnel, expansion of our facilities
and working capital. We may also use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire
or invest in businesses, products, or technologies that are complementary to
our own. While we periodically engage in preliminary discussions with respect
to acquisitions, we are not currently a party to any agreements or commitments,
and we have no understandings with respect to any acquisitions or investments.

factors, including the progress of our product development efforts and the
amount of cash generated or used by our operations. We have not determined the

Of the net proceeds that we will receive from the offering, we expect to use 
approximately: 

- $17.0 million for research, development and clinical activities; 

- $9.0 million for manufacturing and commercialization of existing and future 
products; and 

- $6.0 million for capital expenditures. 

We intend to use the remainder of the net proceeds for general corporate 
purposes. The amounts and timing of these expenditures may vary depending on a 
number of factors, including the amount of cash generated by our operations, 
competitive and technological developments and the rate of growth, if any, of 
our business. We also may use a portion of the net proceeds to acquire 
additional businesses, products and technologies, to lease or build additional

offering. Pending the uses described above, we will invest the net proceeds of 
this offering in short-term, interest-bearing investment-grade securities. We 
cannot predict whether the proceeds will be invested to yield a favorable 
return. Based upon our current plans, we believe that our available cash, cash

Manufacturing equipment includes amounts allocated for the purchase and 
installation of manufacturing equipment for: 
o an automated liquid line; 

o an automated powder line; 

o other automated equipment to meet the higher standards of over-the-counter 
drug manufacturing; and 

o interior construction of additional manufacturing facilities. 

Debt retirement includes amounts to be expended to repay all of our 
indebtedness outstanding under: 

o the credit line portion of our existing credit facility with The CIT 
Group/Credit Finance of approximately $650,000, including fees and accrued and 
unpaid interest;

of America of approximately $503,000, including fees and accrued and unpaid 
interest;

interest at the Prime Rate of The Chase Manhattan Bank in New York, New York, 
plus 2.25% per annum on the unpaid outstanding principal of each advance, 
payable monthly. The note is secured by a blanket lien on all of our assets, 
exclusive of certain leased assets. 
We believe that retirement of this debt will reduce our interest expense and 
debt related administrative expenses, increase our cash flow and liquidity, and 
improve our overall financial stability. 

Business expansion includes amounts to be expended for: 

o the hiring of additional personnel including office, accounting, production, 
warehouse and management;

expansion.

short-term interest bearing investment grade securities or similar quality 
investments. Based upon our current operating plan, we anticipate that cash 
flow from operations, together with the net proceeds of this offering, will be 
sufficient to satisfy our working capital requirements for at least 12 months."

offering are estimated to be approximately $63.6 million ($73.4 million if the 
underwriters' over-allotment option is exercised in full), after deducting the 
underwriting discount and commission and estimated offering expenses. Our net 
proceeds from the sale of 66,667 ordinary shares to Alan C. Draper, one of our 
executive officers and directors, at a price of $15.00 per share are estimated 
to be $1.0 million. We intend to use the proceeds of this offering and of this 
sale to Mr. Draper as follows: 

- approximately $21.0 million to repay existing debt under our credit 
facilities which is unrelated to our acquisition of assets from the Continental 
group of companies and which matures at various dates within the next 12 months 
and bears interest at rates ranging from 6.5% to 15%; 

- approximately $14.1 million to repay the indebtedness incurred to finance the 
acquisition of assets from the Continental group of companies including the 
approximately $3.0 million payment paid on October 31, 2000(1); 

- approximately $20.0 million for strategic investments in and acquisitions of 
businesses and information technology; and 

- approximately $9.5 million for general corporate purposes. 

The approximately $21.0 million of debt we intend to repay with proceeds from 
this offering, which is unrelated to our acquisition of assets from the 
Continental group of companies, was incurred within the last year. 
Approximately $12.0 million of this debt was incurred in connection with 
acquisitions and the remainder was used for general working capital purposes. 

The $5.0 million of indebtedness from Gensec Ireland Limited that we incurred 
to partially fund the purchase price for the assets we acquired from the 
Continental group of companies bears interest at the rate of 340 basis points 
above LIBOR, and this interest rate increases by 20 basis points per month 
after February 2001 if our offering has not closed by then. Amounts borrowed 
under the facility must be repaid in 12 equal monthly installments beginning 
one month from the date the loan was made; however, all outstanding amounts 
become due and payable one month after the date this offering closes. The 
remaining $9.0 million of debt used to fund the acquisition was borrowed under 
various credit facilities and bears interest between 6.5% and 15%. Such debt 
matures at various dates within the next 12 months. 

We anticipate utilizing a portion of the proceeds from this offering to make 
acquisitions of businesses which will support our strategic objectives in the 
freight forwarding and supply chain management industry provided that we can 
identify and acquire suitable businesses. 

The amounts and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous 
factors, including the amount and extent of our acquisitions, our marketing 
activities, our investments in technology and the amount of cash generated by 
our operations. Actual expenditures may vary substantially from our estimates. 
We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the proceeds for other 
purposes. The failure of our management to use such funds effectively could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, results of operations and 
financial condition. Pending application of the net proceeds, we intend to 
invest the net proceeds of this offering in short-term, investment-grade, 
interest-bearing securities. 

(1) If this offering is not completed by November 30, 2000, then we will pay an 
additional $2.5 million of the purchase price for the assets we acquired from 
the Continental group of companies in cash, rather than by issuing the number 
of our ordinary shares which results from dividing $2.5 million by the per 
share offering price in this offering, and we will then use an additional $2.5 
million of the proceeds of this offering to repay indebtedness incurred to 
finance this payment."

- $8.8 million will be loaned to the employee stock ownership plan to fund its 
purchase of common stock; 

- $20.2 million will be retained by Bank Mutual. 

The amount of cash needed for the First Northern merger will vary between 30% 
and 60% of the total merger consideration. Assuming that 60% of the total 
consideration is paid in cash, the total cash payment will be approximately 
$75.4 million. If a higher percentage is paid in stock, the cash needs will 
decrease. For example, if 50% of the total consideration is paid in cash and 
50% in stock, the total cash payment will be approximately $62.8 million. See 
""The Parties -- First Northern Savings; The First Northern Merger"". 
Bank Mutual will obtain the additional funds to pay the balance of the purchase 
price, together with the costs of the merger and required cash-out of First 
Northern stock options, from Mutual Savings' and First Northern Savings' 
existing capital and earnings. 

Bank Mutual may use some of the net proceeds of the offering as a possible 
source of funds to pay dividends to shareholders, to repurchase common stock, 
to finance the possible acquisition of other financial institutions and other 
businesses that are related to banking, or for other general corporate purposes."

common stock, offered by us at the initial public offering price of $12.00 per 
share, will be $54.4 million, after deducting the underwriting discounts and 
commissions and estimated offering expenses. We will not receive any proceeds 
from the sale of shares by the selling stockholders. 

We intend: 

. to use approximately $11.9 million of the net proceeds to repay our senior 
debt obligations outstanding as of September 30, 2000, bearing interest, at our 
option, at the prime rate plus 2% and a Eurodollar- based rate plus 3% and 
having a maturity date of October 2003, pursuant to our existing credit 
agreement. As of September 30, 2000, the interest rate on our senior debt 
obligations (using our Eurodollar-based rate option) was 9.69%; 

. to use approximately $26.3 million of the net proceeds to redeem the balance 
due on our subordinated notes as of September 30, 2000, bearing 12% interest 
per annum and having a maturity date of April 15, 2004. 

After repayment of our outstanding debt, we currently have no specific plans 
for the remaining net proceeds from this offering. In general, we would use the 
funds for working capital and general corporate purposes, including expansion 
of sales and marketing activities, enhancement of our technology infrastructure, 
possible acquisitions and possible international expansion. We currently have 
no commitments or agreements to make any acquisitions and may not make any 
acquisitions in the future. We have not reserved or allocated the balance of 
the net proceeds for any specific transaction, and we cannot specify with 
certainty how we will use the balance of the net proceeds. The amounts and 
timing of these expenditures will vary significantly depending on a number of 
factors, including, but not limited to, the amount of cash generated by our 
operations. We may find it necessary or advisable to use portions of the 
balance of the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad 
discretion in the application of the balance of the net proceeds. Pending these 
uses, we intend to invest the net proceeds in United States government 
securities and other short-term, investment-grade, interest-bearing instruments.

Operations--Liquidity and Capital Resources"" for additional information

stock we are offering, at an assumed initial public offering price of $11.50 per
share, will be approximately $41.6 million after deducting the underwriting
discounts and estimated offering expenses payable by us. We expect to use the
net proceeds as follows:
- approximately $24.0 million for research and development activities, including
  support of clinical trials;
- approximately $8.0 million for capital expenditures related to equipment
  purchases and facility expansion; and
- the balance for other general corporate purposes, including possible
  acquisitions of complementary technology, products or businesses.
The amount and timing of our actual expenditures will depend upon numerous
factors, including progress of our product development programs, the number and
breadth of these programs, future revenue growth, if any, achievement of
milestones under corporate collaborations and licensing arrangements, our
ability to establish and maintain corporate collaborations and other
arrangements, the progress of the development efforts of our corporate
collaborators and the amount of cash, if any, generated by our operations. We
have no present understandings, commitments or agreements to enter into any
potential acquisitions or investments. Further, the amounts above are only broad
estimates and we have not determined with any certainty the amounts we plan to
spend on any of the areas listed above or the timing of these expenditures. As a
result, our management will have broad discretion to allocate the net proceeds
from this offering. Pending application of the net proceeds as described above,
we intend to invest the net proceeds of the offering in short-term
investment-grade, interest-bearing securities."

     APCapital intends to contribute approximately 50% of the net proceeds from
the offerings to MICOA in exchange for all of the capital stock of MICOA to be
issued in the conversion. APCapital will retain the balance of the net proceeds
from the offerings for financing future acquisitions and for general corporate
purposes, which may include, without limitation, additional contributions to our
subsidiaries. Pending such uses, these proceeds will be temporarily invested by
APCapital in U.S. Government securities, obligations of U.S. commercial banks

Moody's, short term corporate obligations rated AAA or AA by Standard and Poor's
or Aaa or Aa by Moody's, in bank money market funds investing in such
instruments, and in other instruments and securities in which MICOA's surplus
funds are permitted to be invested pursuant to MICOA's investment policy.
Although we have discussions from time to time regarding transactions with other
entities, no acquisitions are probable at the present time and we do not plan to
pursue any such transactions until the conversion is complete. After the
conversion, we plan to aggressively pursue acquisitions, in accordance with our
strategic plan.
 
     The net proceeds paid to MICOA will be used for general operating purposes
and will become part of its capital, thereby expanding underwriting capacity and
permitting further diversification of its business. These funds will also
increase MICOA's surplus, thereby strengthening policyholder protection, in
accordance with the plan of conversion and applicable law. 
 
     Set forth below are our estimated net proceeds, assuming the sale of
10,000,000 shares of common stock at $15.50 per share, the minimum and maximum
of the subscription offering range, the minimum and maximum of the anticipated
offering range in the firm commitment underwritten offering and the sale of an
additional 1,500,000 shares upon the exercise of the underwriters' over-
allotment option, and the expected uses of proceeds by APCapital and MICOA. A
range of proceeds is shown in the table because it is possible that the firm
commitment underwritten offering price may be different than the price paid in
the subscription and best efforts offerings. However, the proceeds from the
offerings will not be less than the proceeds at the minimum nor more than the
proceeds at the maximum of the subscription offering range with the
over-allotment option. Actual offering expenses may vary from those shown on the
table.
  
     We expect that the net proceeds from the sale of the minimum number of
shares of common stock in the offering will be sufficient to satisfy our working
capital needs for the foreseeable future.
