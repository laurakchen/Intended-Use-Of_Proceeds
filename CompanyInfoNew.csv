The Fund initially will invest all of its assets in commodity futures and forward contracts and options on commodity futures and forward contracts, and short-term high grade debt securities constituting collateral assets. The manager has sole authority to determine the percentage of assets that will be: held on deposit with the commodity broker or other custodian, used for other investments, and held in bank accounts to pay current obligations and as reserves. The commodity subadvisor and the collateral subadvisor expect to deposit a portion of the Fund’s net assets with the commodity broker or other custodian as initial margin for investments. It is presently anticipated that the Fund will be able to invest substantially all of its net proceeds in accordance with its investment objective within approximately 30 business days after the completion of the offering. Pending such investment, it is anticipated that the proceeds will be invested in cash and obligations issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies and instrumentalities. The Fund uses only short-term securities to satisfy margin requirements. The manager expects that all entities that will hold or invest the Fund’s assets will be based in the U.S. and will be subject to U.S. regulations. Approximately 25% of the Fund’s assets will normally be committed as margin for commodity futures and forward contracts (approximately half of which will be initial margin and the other half of which will be held to meet variation margin). All of the margin will be held at BCI in an interest-bearing cash account or invested in obligations, selected by the commodity subadvisor, issued or guaranteed by the U.S. government, its agencies or instrumentalities. The notional value of the Fund’s commodity contract positions at the time of investment will not exceed 100% of the liquidation value of the Fund’s assets. However, the percentage of assets committed as margin may be substantially more, or less, than 25% of the Fund’s assets. All interest income is used for the Fund’s benefit.

Of the $16.7 million of debt owed to GLOBAL and its affiliates, as of September 30, 2009, $15.8 million was outstanding under a demand note with Kende Holding kft, which we refer to as Kende, an affiliate of GLOBAL. This debt was incurred in order to fund a portion of the purchase for the SFA acquisition. This demand note bears interest at a rate equal to 8% per annum, based on a 360-day year. The remaining $0.9 million of affiliated debt as of September 30, 2009 is owed under two demand notes payable to Kende and Global Strategies Group (Hong Kong) Ltd, which we refer to as Global Hong Kong, in the amounts of $0.5 million and $0.4 million, respectively. Interest on these two demand notes accrues quarterly based on LIBOR plus a margin of 2.5% determined as of the beginning of each calendar quarter. The debt to be repaid under our credit facility was incurred pursuant to a loan and security agreement entered into on February 9, 2007 with a lender. As of September 30, 2009, $9.9 million and $12.0 million were outstanding under the term loan, and revolving line of credit and overline note portions of the credit facility. Borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at the applicable interest rate (the prime rate, the federal funds rate, LIBOR or an index rate), plus an applicable margin that varies based on a leverage ratio test. We have elected to have borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at the LIBOR rate. For the nine months ended September 30, 2009, the applicable margin was 1.8% to 2.8% for borrowings under our term loan and 1.6% to 2.6% for borrowings under our revolving line of credit. As a result of our entering into an amendment to our loan and security agreement on September 3, 2009, the credit facility matures on February 28, 2011. Under this amendment, effective September 30, 2009, the applicable margin is 2.4% to 3.2% for borrowings under our term loan and 2.2% to 3.0% for borrowings under our revolving line of credit, subject to a minimum interest rate of 3.0%.

We have no commitments with respect to any such acquisition or investment, and we are not currently involved in any negotiations with respect to any such transaction. In the event that we sell only the minimum number of units offered, and therefore, receive only the minimum amount of offering proceeds, we would have less working capital with which to pursue the foregoing.

We intend to expand our existing and add new, CMS-compliant, county-wide networks of medical service providers in Florida by increasing the number of total contracted healthcare providers or establishing new networks by contracting with healthcare providers in the required medical fields in each of our targeted Florida counties.

We intend to spend between $500,000 and $1,000,000, depending on the Bridge Note conversion decisions, to develop, acquire and/or license enhanced software systems for healthcare support and physician services. Also, although we believe our corporate offices are adequate for our current needs, in March 2008 we plan to expand our current office space and add additional satellite offices. We entered into two financing arrangements in October 2007 to obtain working capital which, in the aggregate, resulted in $484,000 in net proceeds to us. Namely, we issued a two-year 10% promissory note, dated December 4, 2007, in the aggregate principal amount of $250,000 to Paulson Investment Company, Inc., representative of the underwriters in this public offering. We agreed to prepay the principal amount of the note, plus accrued interest, at the closing of any public or private financing for which we receive gross proceeds of at least $10,000,000. In addition, we executed a financing agreement with High Capital Funding, LLC, a principal shareholder (HCF), and a third party lender that has no prior affiliation with us (TPL). The financing arrangement involved the issuance of two-year promissory notes to each of HCF and TPL in the aggregate principal amounts of $166,667 and $83,333, respectively. In satisfaction of the notes in full, we agreed to pay to HCF and TPL $238,094 and $119,047, respectively, with $71,427 and $35,714 representing the respective original issue discounts on the HCF and TPL notes. We also agreed to prepay the full principal amount of the notes at the closing of any public or private financing for which we receive gross proceeds of at least $10,000,000. In the event of default on these notes, including the failure to make the prepayment required thereunder, the interest on the notes will become immediately due and payable at the rate of 3% per month on the principal amount outstanding. We paid a 5% cash commission in the amount $12,500 to Newbridge Securities Corporation, one of the underwriters in this offering, in connection with the HCF and TPL financings. Net proceeds to us from the HCF and TPL financing arrangements was in the amount of $234,000. All three promissory notes contain events of default and other terms and provisions customary for instruments of this nature. We have agreed to pay the income taxes associated with the conversion of up to 50% of the accrued but unpaid compensation amounts owed to Mr. Guillama and Mr. Cohen, which are estimated to be $377,422. The remaining balance of the accrued but unpaid compensation owed to Mr. Guillama and Mr. Cohen will be converted into a two year promissory note bearing interest at 8%. The amounts allocated for working capital purposes also include amounts allocated to future acquisitions of businesses and technology. We currently do not have any agreements or specific plans to acquire other companies. In addition, a certain amount, which we are currently unable to estimate precisely, may be used to repay any Bridge Notes that are not converted. In addition, we agreed to repurchase 70,911 warrants from Newbridge from the proceeds of this offering at a total cost of $70,911. In November 2007, we requested that the bridge investors amend their prior agreements with us and convert their Bridge Notes into unregistered securities otherwise identical to the units offered in this Public Offering (the “Conversion Securities”). We gave the bridge investors two conversion options.  Under the first option, the Bridge Notes will convert into the Conversion Securities at 100% of the unit public offering price, which Conversion Securities will be subject to a one year lockup in exchange for a lockup fee of 3% of the aggregate amount of principal and accrued interest, payable quarterly. Under the second option, the Bridge Notes will convert into the Conversion Securities at a 30% discount to the unit price in this Public Offering, which Conversion Securities will be subject to a two year lockup in exchange for a lockup fee of 3% of the aggregate amount of principal and accrued interest, payable quarterly for one year. Of the total of $6,050,000 Bridge Notes, a total of $1,727,500, plus interest, or 28.55%, elected to convert under Option 1 into 172,983 units; and $2,922,500, plus interest, or 48.31%, elected to convert under Option 2 into 414,870 units. Under both options, the cash payment for the first three months will be paid in advance at the closing of this Public Offering and the payments for the remaining nine months will be paid in arrears after each quarter. Similarly, under both options, the cash payment is only payable for each full quarter during which the Conversion Securities are subject to the lockups. Finally, under both options, the lockups may be released at any time after six months in the representative’s discretion. The amounts and timing of our expenditures will depend on numerous factors, including the results of our operations, marketing activities, competition and the amount of cash generated or used by our operations. We may change these anticipated uses as we deem appropriate. We may find it necessary or advisable to use the net proceeds for other purposes, and we will have broad discretion in the application of the balance of the net proceeds. Pending the uses described above, we intend to invest the net proceeds in certificates of deposit, short-term obligations of the United States government or other money-market instruments that are rated investment grade or its equivalent. We currently estimate that the proceeds of this offering will be sufficient to enable us to meet our working capital requirements for a minimum of 12 months.",,,,,,,CAPITOL ACQUISITION CORP,,,424B4,11/9/07,,"The amount of net proceeds from this offering not held in trust will remain constant at $600,000 even if the underwriters’ over-allotment is exercised. In addition, $3,250,000 of interest income earned on the amounts held in the trust account will be available to us to pay for our working capital requirements. For purposes of presentation, the full amount available to us is shown as the total amount of net proceeds available to us immediately following the offering. These are estimates only. Our actual expenditures for some or all of these items may differ from the estimates set forth herein. For example, we may incur greater legal and accounting expenses than our current estimates in connection with negotiating and structuring an initial business combination based upon the level of complexity of that business combination. We do not anticipate any change in our intended use of proceeds, other than fluctuations among the current categories of allocated expenses, which fluctuations, to the extent they exceed current estimates for any specific category of expenses, would be deducted from our excess working capital. A total of approximately $246.3 million (or approximately $282.4 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full), of the net proceeds from this offering and the sale of the sponsors’ warrants described in this prospectus, including approximately $8.1 million (or approximately $9.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) of deferred underwriting discounts and commissions will be placed in the trust account at Merrill Lynch with Continental Stock Transfer & Trust Company, as trustee. The proceeds held in the trust account will be invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except for a portion of the interest income that may be released to us, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of our initial business combination or our liquidation. All amounts held in the trust account that are not paid to public stockholders who elect to exercise their conversion rights or released to us as interest income will be released on closing of our initial business combination with one or more target businesses which collectively have a fair market value of at least 80% of the balance in the trust account (excluding deferred underwriting discounts and commissions of approximately $8.1 million or approximately $9.3 million if the underwriters’ over-allotment option is exercised in full) at the time of such initial business combination, subject to a majority of our public stockholders voting in favor of the initial business combination and less than 30% of the public stockholders electing their conversion rights and subject to such deferred underwriting discount and commission having been paid to the underwriters. On release of funds from the trust account and after payment of the conversion price to any public stockholders who exercise their conversion rights, the underwriters will receive their deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, and the remaining funds will be released to us and can be used to pay all or a portion of the purchase price of the business or businesses with which our initial combination occurs. If the initial business combination is paid for using stock or debt securities, we may apply the cash released to us from the trust account to general corporate purposes, including for maintenance or expansion of operations of acquired business or businesses, the payment of principal or interest due on indebtedness incurred in consummating our initial business combination, to fund the purchase of other companies, or for working capital. We expect that due diligence of prospective target businesses will be performed by some or all of the members of our management team and may include engaging market research firms and/or third party consultants. Members of our management team, or their affiliates, will not receive any compensation for services rendered prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination, but would be reimbursed for any out-of-pocket expenses (such as travel expenses) incurred in connection with activities on our behalf such as due diligence activities. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. Our audit committee will review and approve all reimbursements and payments made to any founder or member of our management team or special advisor and our or their respective affiliates and any reimbursements and payments to members of our audit committee will be reviewed and approved by our board of directors, with the interested director or directors abstaining from such review and approval. We believe that amounts not held in the trust account as well as the interest income earned on the trust account balance released to us to pay any tax obligations and interest income of up to $3.25 million earned on the trust account balance that may be released to us will be sufficient to pay the costs and expenses to which such proceeds are allocated. This belief is based on the fact that in-depth due diligence will be undertaken only after we have negotiated and signed a letter of intent or other preliminary agreement that addresses the terms of an initial business combination. However, if our estimate of the costs of undertaking in-depth due diligence and negotiating an initial business combination is less than the actual amount necessary to do so, we may be required to raise additional capital, the amount, availability and cost of which is currently not ascertainable. In this event, we could seek such additional capital through loans or additional investments from members of our management team, but such members of our management team are not under any obligation to advance funds to, or invest in, us. If we complete an initial business combination, the out-of-pocket expenses incurred by members of our management team prior to the initial business combination’s closing will become an obligation of the post-combination business, assuming these out-of-pocket expenses have not been reimbursed prior to the closing. These expenses would be a liability of the post-combination business and would be treated in a manner similar to any other account payable of the combined business. Members of our management team may, as part of any such combination, negotiate the repayment of some or all of any such expenses. If the target business’ owners do not agree to such repayment, this could cause our management team to view such potential business combination unfavorably and result in a conflict of interest. To the extent that our capital stock is used in whole or in part as consideration to effect an initial business combination, the proceeds held in the trust account as well as any other net proceeds not expended will be used to finance the operations of the target business. Such working capital funds could be used in a variety of ways including continuing or expanding the target business’ operations, for strategic acquisitions and for marketing, research and development of existing or new products. Such funds could also be used to repay any operating expenses or finders’ fees which we had incurred prior to the completion of our business combination if the funds available to us outside of the trust account were insufficient to cover such expenses. As of the date of this prospectus, Leland Investments Inc. has advanced to us an aggregate of $95,000 which was used to pay a portion of the expenses of this offering referenced in the line items above for the SEC registration fee, Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, or FINRA, filing fee, the non-refundable portion of the American Stock Exchange fee and accounting and legal fees and expenses. The loan is non-interest bearing, unsecured and is due at the earlier of July 13, 2008 or the consummation of this offering. The loan will be repaid out of the proceeds of this offering not being placed in the trust account. The net proceeds of this offering not held in the trust account and not immediately required for the purposes set forth above will be invested only in United States “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act of 1940 having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act of 1940, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Interest income earned on the trust account balance released to us to pay any tax obligations as well as interest income of up to $3.25 million earned on the trust account balance may be releasable to us from the trust account to fund a portion of our working capital requirements. No compensation of any kind (including finder’s and consulting fees or other similar compensation) will be paid to our founders or members of our management team or special advisors or any of our or their respective affiliates, for services rendered to us prior to or in connection with the consummation of our initial business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, members of our management team will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses and performing due diligence on suitable business combinations. To the extent that such expenses exceed the available proceeds not deposited in the trust account and interest income of up to $3.25 million that is released to us from the trust account, such out-of-pocket expenses would not be reimbursed by us prior to our consummation of an initial business combination. In the event an initial business combination is consummated by us and irrespective of whether such persons remain associated with us, our audit committee and/or our board of directors may determine to reimburse such persons for such expenses. There is no limit on the amount of such expenses reimbursable by us to such persons. A public stockholder will be entitled to receive funds from the trust account only in the event of our liquidation if we fail to complete an initial business combination within the allotted time or if the public stockholder seeks to convert such shares into cash in connection with an initial business combination that the public stockholder voted against and that we actually complete. In no other circumstances will a public stockholder have any right or interest of any kind in or to funds in the trust account. On completion of our initial business combination, the underwriters will receive the deferred underwriters’ discounts and commissions held in the trust account. If we do not complete an initial business combination and the trustee must therefore distribute the balance in the trust account, the underwriters have agreed (i) on our liquidation to forfeit any rights or claims to the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, including any accrued interest thereon, then in the trust account, and (ii) that the trustee is authorized to distribute the deferred underwriting discounts and commissions, together with any accrued interest thereon, net of income taxes payable on such interest, to the public stockholders on a pro rata basis.",,,,,,,TITAN MACHINERY INC,,,424B4,12/6/07,,"We estimate that the net proceeds from our sale of shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $35 million, or approximately $42 million if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option in full. This estimate is based upon the initial public offering price of $8.50 per share, less estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and offering expenses payable by us. We intend to use these net proceeds as follows: to fund potential acquisitions of CNH agricultural and construction equipment dealerships; for general corporate purposes, including working capital needs; ·       to pay accrued cash dividends in the aggregate amount of $441,027 upon the conversion of all of our outstanding preferred stock; ·       to repay subordinated debentures in the aggregate principal amount of $142,424.

The funds held in trust will be invested only in US “government securities” within the meaning of Section 2(a)(16) of the Investment Company Act having a maturity of 180 days or less, or in money market funds meeting certain conditions under Rule 2a-7 promulgated under the Investment Company Act, so that we are not deemed to be an investment company under the Investment Company Act. Except with respect to $1,350,000 of interest income, net of taxes, that may be released to us to fund operating expenses, the proceeds held in trust will not be released from the trust account until the earlier of the completion of a business combination or our liquidation. The proceeds held in the trust account may be used as consideration to pay the sellers of a target business with which we complete a business combination. We have agreed to pay Surfmax Corporation, a company wholly-owned by George Lu, our Chief Executive Officer and President, $7,500 per month for office space and general and administrative services. We believe that such fee is at least as favorable as we could have obtained from an unaffiliated person. Upon completion of a business combination or our liquidation, we will no longer be required to pay these monthly fees. Other than the $7,500 administrative fees to Surfmax Corporation described above, no compensation of any kind (including finder’s, consulting or other similar fees) will be paid to any of our existing officers, directors, special advisors, stockholders, or any of their affiliates, prior to, or for any services they render in order to effectuate, the consummation of the business combination (regardless of the type of transaction that it is). However, such individuals will receive reimbursement for any out-of-pocket expenses incurred by them in connection with activities on our behalf, such as identifying potential target businesses, performing business due diligence on suitable target businesses and business combinations, as well as traveling to and from the offices, plants or similar locations of prospective target businesses to examine their operations. Reimbursement for such expenses will be paid by us out of the funds not held in trust and currently allocated to “Legal, accounting and other third-party expenses attendant to the due diligence investigation, structuring and negotiation of a business combination,” “Due diligence of prospective target businesses by officers, directors, existing stockholders or special advisors” and “Working capital to cover miscellaneous expenses, D&O insurance, taxes, general corporate purposes, dissolution obligations and reserves.” Since the role of present management after a business combination is uncertain, we have no ability to determine what remuneration, if any, will be paid to those persons after a business combination.",,,,,,,NEUTRAL TANDEM INC,,,424B4,11/2/07,,"We estimate that our net proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock in this offering will be approximately $78,975,000 ($91,962,307 if the underwriters exercise their over-allotment option), based on the initial public offering price of $14.00 per share of common stock and after deducting the estimated underwriting discounts and commissions and estimated offering expenses payable by us.
